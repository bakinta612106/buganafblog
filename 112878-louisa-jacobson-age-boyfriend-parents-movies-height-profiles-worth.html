Meryl Streep is one of the most successful and highly celebrated triple <i>Academy Award</i>-winning actresses in Hollywood. She passed her skills along to her three daughters, Louisa, Grace, Mamie, and her son Henry Wolfe, who have all taken an interest in showbiz. While her daughters have all leaned towards the acting path, Henry Wolfe has chosen a musical route as a musician and songwriter. Their father, Don Gummer, is just as talented, focusing his skills in contemporary art as a distinguished sculptor.</p><p class=align-left>The young <a href=#>actress </a>and model is the youngest of her siblings, growing up in their $3-million family estate in Brentwood, Los Angeles.
