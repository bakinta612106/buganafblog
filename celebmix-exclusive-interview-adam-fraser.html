He has continued to grow in popularity over the years and has also gathered a loyal and dedicated legion of followers, which is ever increasing.</p><p>Here at CelebMix, we had the opportunity to exclusively speak with Adam Fraser about his role primarily as a social media influencer, his social media inspirations and his supporters. Keep reading to check out our exclusive interview!</p><p><strong>As a social media influencer, what would a normal day in your life consist of?</strong></p><p>‘A normal day for me would be: making sure all my socials are up to a standard that I like them to be, then have a few meetings, try and film a video and normally travelling.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your favourite thing about your job?</strong></p><p>‘My favourite thing about what I do is meeting my supporters. They are always so happy when they meet me – it’s the best feeling ever.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Social media does have its downsides, such as cyber-bullying. How do you deal with the negative aspect of social media?</strong></p><p>‘I just make sure everything I do is in a positive way. I dislike negativity on my socials. But obviously if anyone is getting bullied online, I make sure they know I’m here for them to talk to.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other than the cyber-bullying, do you feel there are any downsides to your position?</strong></p><p>‘There’s a lot of negativity thrown at the position that I am in. A lot of people don’t understand what I do, but all that matters is the people that care understand.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have a preference of social media to use? Do you find one method easier than others to communicate with your supporters?</strong></p><p>‘I think both Instagram and Twitter are really good for different things. Instagram is more about me posting pictures to my liking and Twitter is more me communicating with fans. I like them both.’</p><p><strong>Your role inevitably comes with a lot of pressure. How do you cope with this?</strong></p><p>‘I just make sure it doesn’t all build up on me. If it becomes too much pressure, I will just have a few days off and then carry on.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What has been a stand-out moment in your career for you so far?</strong></p><p>‘The stand-out moment so far will have to be when I went to Fusion Festival and got mobbed. This was the first real time I realised how much of an effect I have on people.’&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m so grateful for the people that are in my life right now, that’s also including every single one of you!! Thank you for being you. ??</p><p>— Adam Fraser (@AdamFraserrUK) <a href=#>September 5, 2018</a></p><p><strong>Is there anything in particular you would like to achieve during your career?</strong></p><p>‘I would like to build my YouTube up to how it used to be and just keep growing the fan-base; maybe travel to LA, as I’ve always wanted to go there.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who are your social media inspirations?</strong></p><p>‘My inspirations in social media are Pointless Blog (Alfie Deyes) – just generally because he was the first guy that I watched on YouTube and I’ve loved seeing him grow in to what he is now. Also Fousey, I just respect how much he believes in himself – it’s truly inspiring.’</p><p><strong>Finally, do you have a message for your supporters?</strong></p><p>‘I just want to say how much I appreciate the support and it genuinely means the world to me, so thank you for everything you’ve done.’&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you stay up-to-date with Adam Fraser on his social media channels:</p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a>;</p><p><a href=#>YouTube</a>;</p><p><a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><h4>Let us know your thoughts over on Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksKa4xJukorBdmsWkuNSsoK%2BdXZ67tbHRr6Cer12WsaK5jJ%2BpmquVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
