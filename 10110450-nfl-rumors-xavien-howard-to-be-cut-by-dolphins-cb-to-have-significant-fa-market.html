Lock down corners don't hit the market often.</p><p>The <i>Miami Herald</i>'s <a href=# rel=noopener>Barry Jackson</a> reported Wednesday that the Dolphins had not yet informed Howard of their plans and had not asked him to accept a pay cut.</p><p>Although Howard has been part of multiple off-field incidents during his time with the Dolphins, including a <a href=# rel=noopener>2019 arrest</a> on domestic battery charges, it is likely that the decision to cut him was centered around the structure of his contract. Howard's $15.4 million salary in 2024 is not guaranteed, and his cap number is about to skyrocket.</p><p>After costing the Dolphins $10 million against the cap in 2023, that cap hit was set to rise to $26 million next season. That would have put Howard above quarterback Tua Tagovailoa as the fourth-biggest cap hit in Miami.</p><p>The Dolphins will wait until June 1 to make those cap adjustments. Cutting Howard before that date would leave the team with more than $23 million in dead cap and just $2.8 million in savings, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Over the Cap</a>.</p><p>Designating him as one of the team's two post-June 1 cuts, however, leaves the Dolphins with a $7.4 million hit for 2024 and $18.5 million in cap savings.</p><p>The retooling Dolphins plan to clear out more cap space by releasing defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah after a down season in 2023, according to ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam Schefter</a>.</p><p>It's not clear whether Ogbah will be designated as a post-June 1 cut.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWWBdnyMp52lZaKqurC%2B0mavmq6ZmrtutM6wmKucXam8bq7EZpqurF2Xxm6wzqWnoaGeqHqkroytpmagkauybr%2FIoKWinpmYrq%2FAjJ%2BYZqWRp7imwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
