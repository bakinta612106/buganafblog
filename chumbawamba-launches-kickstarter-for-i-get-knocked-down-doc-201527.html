Eighteen years after they dominated the airwaves with the impossible-to-escape hit song "Tubthumping," Chumbawamba is staging a comeback of sorts — or getting up again, if you will — by launching a <a href=#>Kickstarter</a> campaign for a documentary about the band.</p><p>Former member <strong>Dunstan Bruce</strong> hopes to raise $62,915 (or 40,000 pounds) to tell the "untold story" behind Chumbawamba and its most famous (or infamous, depending on who you ask) pop anthem.</p><p>"For you, that was probably just a one-hit wonder that you vaguely remember dancing to back in the '90s," he says in a video for the campaign. "But for me, that was the very small tip of a very, very large iceberg. And it's part of a hilarious and fascinating story that spanned over 30 years. And that's the story I want to share with you."</p><p>Joining Bruce in his quest is fellow former member <strong>Alice Nutter</strong>. As she tells it, there was much more to the band than "pissing the night away." In fact, she claims they're indirectly responsible for "moving politics forward" in the UK.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Stuff we did with the money had invisible repercussions that nobody would ever connect to Chumbawamba," she shares.</p><p>Bruce and Nutter plan to reunite the band to "get the inside story, to get the truth — or at least different versions of the truth…about what happened when a bunch of anarchists from the north of England had a worldwide hit totally by accident."</p><p>As of Thursday afternoon, July 2, 229 backers had pledged more than $12,500, with 28 days left in the campaign. Rewards range from a sheet of "Chumbawamba manifesto stickers" to set visit or private DJ set from Bruce himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnJ%2BupZKWxKK5wZpkpZmlo7CpsdJmoqKbm6jBor7Tnqlmnp%2Bneqp5xp6rZqOepLCsscNmm6ivnmKxsK%2BMa2dqbWJs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
