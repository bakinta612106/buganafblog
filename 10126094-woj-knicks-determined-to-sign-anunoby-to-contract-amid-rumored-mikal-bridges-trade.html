The Knicks are loading up on wings to match up with the NBA champion Boston Celtics.</p>Ian Begley <span class=acct>@IanBegley</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Told that Knicks' trade for Mikal Bridges does not change their hope that they can re-sign free agent OG Anunoby. That remains a priority for the club.</p>Chris Mannix <span class=acct>@SIChrisMannix</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>New York intends to be aggressive in re-signing Anunoby, a source told &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SInow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SInow&lt;/a>. Bridges is not viewed as an OG replacement but another weapon in what could be a stingy Knicks defense. &lt;a href="https://t.co/pNQ7L6WJ3E">https://t.co/pNQ7L6WJ3E&lt;/a></p><p>Per <a href=# rel=noopener>Wojnarowski</a>, the Knicks have agreed to trade Bojan Bogdanovic, "four unprotected picks (2025, 2027, 2029, 2031), a 2025 protected Milwaukee first, a 2028 unprotected pick swap and a 2025 second-round pick" for Bridges plus a 2026 second-round pick.</p><p>The Knicks went <a href=# rel=noopener>20-3</a> when Anunoby played for them in the regular season. They won their first-round series with the Philadelphia 76ers with him aboard.</p><p>They won Game 1 of their second-round series with the Indiana Pacers, and then Anunoby had 28 points in 28 minutes before suffering a right hamstring strain. He played five minutes for the rest of the series, trying to play in Game 7 before his injury prevented him from doing so. The Knicks lost that game 130-109 and the series 4-3.</p><p>Even though the Knicks now reportedly have Bridges, who has two years and <a href=# rel=noopener>$48.2 million</a> left on his deal and also played the wing like Anunoby, it's clear why the Knicks want OG back. Simply put, they were highly successful with him aboard, and having him and Bridges on the same team only makes the Knicks stronger.</p><p>Of course, it takes two to tango, and the price and fit have to be right for Anunoby. He's also bound to have other interest from suitors in free agency.</p><p>Ultimately, the Knicks have made a massive move in hopes of winning their first NBA championship since 1973, and bringing Anunoby back would be a huge win for the team in search of that goal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmt9eoCMsKajZZujtqS30mabnqyVp7qqusSdZK2nXai2qLqMmqWupp%2BXxm7AzmaaqKakp66kwIyapKKcXafCrrvRnptmpZmgrq15waugnZ%2BVqHq1vsCdnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
