On Saturday, Aug. 22,<strong> Catelynn Lowell</strong> and <strong>Tyler Baltierra</strong> tied the knot after a 10-year romance. Though all eyes were on the Teen Mom OG bride, many fans couldn’t help but notice that one of her costar guests had significantly slimmed down.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amber Portwood</strong> attended the Charlevoix, Michigan festivities with her fiancé, <strong>Matt Baier,</strong> looking trim and healthy.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Had such an amazing time at <a href=#>@TylerBaltierra</a> & @CatelynnLowells wedding. And we had our first dance there too..love???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mXBJPNAlZk</a></p><p>— Amber Portwood (@AmberLPortwood) <a href=#>August 24, 2015</a></p><p>“Had such an amazing time at @TylerBaltierra & @CatelynnLowells wedding. And we had our first dance there too..love,” Portwood, 25, captioned the photo of herself in a short, black lace-covered tan dress.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality star, who spent 17 months in jail on drug-related charges between 2012 and 2013, has since cleaned up her act and is living a clean, sober lifestyle. She <a href=#>revealed earlier this month</a> via Twitter that she had dropped 36 pounds and had 15 more to go thanks to her new diet, which involves “cutting out bad carbs” and trying not to eat trans fats.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Me and my babe looking all suave at Cate and Ty's wedding yesterday???? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/T6lQtuvTgs</a></p><p>— Amber Portwood (@AmberLPortwood) <a href=#>August 23, 2015</a></p><p>She wasn’t the only MTV regular to attend the nuptials (though obviously estranged costar <strong>Farrah Abraham</strong> was not invited), which took place at the picturesque Castle Farms venue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maci Bookout,</strong> who welcomed daughter <strong>Jayde Carter </strong>in May, also looked fabulous in a white top and tan skirt. She attended the event with her longtime love (and Jayde’s father), <strong>Taylor McKinney</strong>. The pair are likely the next Teen Mom stars to be heading down the aisle, though McKinney hasn’t put a ring on Bookout’s finger yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The redheaded Tennessee native spent much of last season of Teen Mom OG questioning why McKinney had yet to propose. The bearded stud wasn’t the only significant other to attend Lowell and Baltierra’s big day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Javi Marroquin</strong> and his wife, <strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong>, of Teen Mom 2 fame also got down on the dance floor, wearing masquerade masks at the fairy-tale-themed wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, all three Teen Mom gals posed together for photos at the reception, which Lowry posted via Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>“These girls! Finally together to celebrate some awesome people on their wedding night @macideshanebookout,” she captioned the pic.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And it seems after after the pair said their “I dos,” Portwood and Baier stuck around for a special family barbecue.&nbsp;</p><p>“We loved hanging out with your family..we had a great time with beautiful people..we love you guy's @TylerBaltierra,” Portwood tweeted late on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>“@AmberLPortwood SO happy that you guys came & barbecued with my family! You fit right in haha!” groom Baltierra replied.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJimmpWnerG70a2uqKeUYsSmtcahq2akn6jAbq%2FArZylsZ6jeq271p6jpWWnmrGltc2gZKmhk6nCs7HSZmlpaWVngXk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
