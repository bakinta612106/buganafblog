"But again, whatever. Whatever's in God's hands, in his cards, I just kind of rock with that."</p><p>Landry spent the 2022 season with the New Orleans Saints, his hometown team. Unfortunately, he recorded career lows across the board with 25 catches for 272 yards and one touchdown while being limited to nine games due to an ankle injury. He also suffered a knee sprain in 2021 that limited him to 12 games in his final season with the Cleveland Browns.</p><p>He used last year to recover and said he always planned for a return in 2024, eventually deciding to pursue a spot with the Jaguars after receiving calls from multiple teams.</p><p>"It was stressful [sitting out 2023 while he got healthy]," Landry said. "I learned a lot about the man and getting healthy and things like that. Spending more time with family kept me grounded. Had a good support system, but it's always good to be back out here."</p><p>The 31-year-old began his career with the Miami Dolphins as a second-round pick in the 2014 draft. He spent four seasons in Miami before being traded to Cleveland in 2018. He was selected to five straight Pro Bowls from 2015 to 2019 and recorded over 1,000 receiving yards three times in his career. He also led the NFL in receptions in 2017 with 112.</p><p>"Being out at football last year was very tough. And like I said, it made me grounded, but it also made me humble and grateful to have opportunities. Even like this is a good stepping stone toward the next chapter of what I'm looking for," he said. "We've got another day. But for me, I just want to be as clean as possible, be the best teammate I could possibly be and really let everything else play out how it does."</p><p>If he earns a contract from the Jaguars, Landry will join a talented offense led by quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Jacksonville added more firepower by using the No. 23 pick in this year's draft to select wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. out of LSU, which is Landry's alma mater.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmWCeYKMo5irrpmoeq2tzZ2psmWYpL2qusZmq6hllZa%2Fr3nJmp6umaKoeqS7za2pmpukYravec2fo2aekWKup8DEq2Srp5%2BgtqZ5zKKlopuRor1uwNGypq6s</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
