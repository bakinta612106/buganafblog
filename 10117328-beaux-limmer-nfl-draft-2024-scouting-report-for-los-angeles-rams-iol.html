He amassed 12 starts inside first-year offensive coordinator Dan Enos' 60-40 run-pass split, multiple run scheme. Limmer has an athletic, lean and wiry build with very good athletic ability and solid play strength.</p><p>Limmer is a springy, rangy run-blocker with loose hips and wiry strength who understands how to adjust leverage and positioning to strain, sustain and secure blocks. He has experience in a multiple run scheme executing a variety of concepts, but he excels most while working zone combinations and back blocks.</p><p>Limmer has the quickness and balance to hit landmarks and intersect moving targets, but he needs to temper his overaggressive, frenetic energy to avoid overshooting his target and getting beat across his face.</p><p>In pass protection, Limmer uses his very good athletic ability and reactionary quickness to get to his spots and recover out of compromising positions. However, his narrow, lean build makes it a chore to consistently anchor against the bull rush and maintain the integrity of the pocket on pick attempts.</p><p>Overall, Limmer is a very athletic, lean, nimble blocker with wiry strength who can strain to finish blocks. His extensive guard experience should at least help him cross-train across the interior as a swing backup in the NFL right away, but his narrow frame and minimal girth likely pigeonholes his path into a starting role as a center-only in a zone-heavy scheme.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 6.8 (Potential Role Player/Contributor — 4th Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 96</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: IOL13</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Daniel Kilgore</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWyAc4SMm5yarahiuaq5zJ6pZqaWoXqlvsCfq2ZqYGeBbr%2FCqKytoZ6cerOxz6iprWWWpL9uuM6sZJqml5q5pr%2BMq5imq12evK0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
