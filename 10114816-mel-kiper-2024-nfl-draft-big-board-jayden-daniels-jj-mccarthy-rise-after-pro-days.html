McCarthy is now the 14th-best player overall and No. 4 quarterback, behind Williams, Daniels and <a href=#>Drake Maye</a> (No. 7 overall).</p><p>Daniels has steadily progressed for Kiper throughout the pre-draft process. The reigning Heisman winner was <a href=# rel=noopener>ranked</a> eighth on his big board that was released in December.</p><p>Before the Super Bowl, Kiper <a href=# rel=noopener>dropped</a> a new big board that had Daniels as the third-best prospect behind Williams and Ohio State wide receiver <a href=#>Marvin Harrison Jr.</a></p><p>After moving Daniels up to No. 2, Kiper praised his "rare ability as a dual-threat playmaker" and cited his "improvement as a passer" last season that will likely make him an early-round-one selection.</p><p>Daniels didn't do any athletic testing at LSU's pro day on Wednesday, but he did throw in front of NFL scouts and executives.</p><p>NFL.com's Bucky Brooks (h/t NFL.com's <a href=# rel=noopener>Eric Edholm</a>) said after watching Daniels throw it was a "solid" performance, but likely didn't do anything to change whatever opinion teams had of him going into the day:</p><p><i>"I can't say that it's been an A-plus workout, but it's been solid. We've seen the ball hit the ground a few times. If you liked Jayden Daniels coming in, there's nothing that has taken place today that would discourage you from doing that.</i></p><p><i>"If you had concerns about his frame, his durability based on what he looked like at LSU, you're still going to have those concerns because he's 210 pounds. It really is a matter of being able to imagine what he could be at his best, and can we put an offense around him that would allow him to play to his strengths, while also allowing the team to stick to their identity on offense?"</i></p><p>McCarthy got a great, totally unbiased endorsement from Jim Harbaugh, who called the Wolverines quarterback's pro day "the best I've ever seen."</p>Tracy Sandler <span class=acct>@TracyFGSN</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jim Harbaugh waxing poetic on J.J. McCarthy and his Pro Day. "Literally, it was the best I've ever seen." A certain reporter listened with pride (I'm the reporter). &lt;a href="https://t.co/mSQTMvKJYw">pic.twitter.com/mSQTMvKJYw&lt;/a></p><p>NFL draft analyst <a href=# rel=noopener>Tony Pauline</a> of SportsKeeda said one person told him McCarthy's pro day was better than Daniels', but the LSU star has "much better arm talent by a wide margin."</p><p>Kiper's assessment of McCarthy's skill set was largely built around having "first-round arm talent" and the ability to "beat defenses with his legs," though he also praised him for having "immense" upside.</p><p>There is little doubt Daniels and McCarthy are going to be selected in the first round. Both players have been <a href=# rel=noopener>connected</a> to the Washington Commanders, who own the No. 2 pick, at different points this offseason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmFcoKMppylZZuevaa%2BjGtna2xdo7OtecOrmJ%2BsXZe2qHnBqJirnF2frrqwxKdknZmenrKtv4yjoWalk5ius8DHsmSroaOaeqKy056pZqiipHqlrdis</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
