The second image featured Alsina flaunting his glowing skin in the midst of taking a shower.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the post, Alsina&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>&nbsp;the caption, “Sailing the soul w/ @encinawellness was so fye.” As the photos circulated online, many brought up Jada Pinkett Smith and how the pair’s entanglement has visibly changed Alsina’s appearance. A couple of individuals even claimed that Alsina was starting to resemble the actress physically.</p><p>“Jada did this! Traumatized him to the point he changed his whole face.”</p><p>“He ain’t been the same since Jada.”</p><p>“Everytime I look at him and tilt my head to the side I see Jada.”</p><p>“He ain’t been right since Jada put that thing on him.”</p><p>“He starting to look like Jada.”</p><p>Among the previous remarks, others mentioned how unrecognizable Alsina looked in the images. One wrote, “Who is this?????” Another said, “(Shocked face emoji) That’s not August.” A third social media user posted, “Wtf happen to him? He have a new face every season YALL.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>August Alsina feels the same way.
