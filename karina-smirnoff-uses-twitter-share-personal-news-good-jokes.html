She rose to fame when she began dancing for the hit reality show Dancing with the Stars way back in the day, and she’s been making us admire her ever since. She’s taken home trophies after teaching stars to dance like the pro she is, and now she’s a bona fide author. She’s written a book with a girlfriend, sharing dating stories that will horrify you from the bottom of your heart, make you laugh out loud and even cause you to be ever-so-grateful for your dirty-underwear-on-the-floor husband. Karina Smirnoff is not going to stop at pro dancer; she’s going all the way. She’s got a lot of talent and she’s not going to let it go to waste.
