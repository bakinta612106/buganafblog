After an undeniably successful career peak in the 1980s, the star has remained relevant and influential for decades, but she has also stirred up controversy and concerns. Despite the dust-ups, she has a devoted following of fans who are hungry for every tidbit they can get about her personal life and habits, including the interesting fact that she <a href=#>doesn’t go to bed until 4am</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One relatively straightforward fact about the pop star had an interviewer questioning the answer, so just how tall is Madonna?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-madonna-has-had-an-iconic-music-career>Madonna has had an iconic music career&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Celebrate 35 years of <a rel=noopener href=#>#WhosThatGirl</a> with the limited edition ‘Super Club Mix’ EP available exclusively at participating independent record stores today! Special release includes the ‘Who’s That Girl’ and ‘Causing A Commotion’ remixes pressed on 12’’ red vinyl. <a rel=noopener href=#>#RecordStoreDay</a> <a rel=noopener href=#>pic.twitter.com/ItnG8RAXmJ</a></p><p>— Madonna (@Madonna) <a rel=noopener href=#>April 23, 2022</a></p></figure><p>Madonna’s origin story is a bit disputed. She said that she bravely came to New York with $35 in her pocket and nothing more, but her brother — who published a tell-all book based on his proximity to his famous sister — suggests <a href=#>that’s not quite true</a>. She did defy their father by dropping out of college to pursue her dreams of becoming a dancer in New York City, but she did so with a network of friends in the Big Apple and a wealthy upper-middle-class background to give her a boost.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the case, there’s no denying that the star found her footing. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Biography.com</a> reports, she was used to toughing it on her own because Madonna lost her mother to breast cancer when she was just five years old. “I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was by not having a mother,” Madonna once explained.&nbsp;</p><p>After arriving in New York City in 1978, Madonna worked odd jobs — including nude art modeling — and pursued her dance career. After she began dating Dan Gilroy — a founding member of the band Breakfast Club — she got into music and performing, and she formed several bands before going solo in 1981. By 1983, she had used her bold personality and business savvy to get a record deal and release&nbsp;Madonna.&nbsp;</p><p>From that moment on, Madonna has been a fashion icon, a pop music staple, and a bonafide superstar.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-madonna-pointed-to-her-powerful-presence-that-gave-the-illusion-of-height>Madonna pointed to her “powerful” presence that gave the illusion of height</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Don-McLean-Once-Reacted-to-Madonnas-Widely-Hated-Cover-of-American-Pie-scaled.jpg><p>Madonna has had an impressive stage presence over the years, frequently touring and releasing new music. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Music</a>‘s discography shows, she’s had a consistent presence with album releases stretching from 1983 to 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>The press has had plenty of reasons to keep up with Madonna. Her high-profile marriage to Sean Penn and their subsequent divorce, for instance, gave the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Tribune</a> a reason to interview her in 1987. During that piece, Madonna’s height came up.&nbsp;</p><p>“I`m 5-foot-4 1/2,” the singer responded. The interviewer suggested she looked a lot taller when she was on stage, and Madonna quipped, “That means I was coming across as powerful.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celeb Heights</a>&nbsp;— yes there’s a celebrity tracking site for everything — lists her current height as 5’3″, and it would make sense that the pop star would have lost a bit from her peak height since she is now 63 years old.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-s-madonna-up-to-recently>What’s Madonna up to recently?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZkKj3QHQPQ?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>While Madonna’s career has been marked by professional success, it’s also been punctuated by controversy and conflict. She’s had plenty of spats and feuds as well as behavior that has <a href=#>had her labeled a real “diva”</a> in the music industry.</p><p>Recent behavior, though, seems less diva-ish and more . . . confusing? Fans have been asking questions since Madonna <a href=#>posted a perplexing TikTok</a>&nbsp;in which she appears with her face close to the screen as her song “Frozen” plays in the background. She moves the camera closer and farther from her face, makes a slow kissing movement, and then cuts off without ever saying anything. Fans voiced feelings of concern and disturbance at the video.&nbsp;</p><p>That odd interaction aside, Madonna has remained a relevant cultural icon, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madonna.com</a> points to a new album release expected in June 2022. The 16-track&nbsp;FINALLY ENOUGH LOVE will feature curated remixes of some of her favorite dance hits.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>Madonna’s Secret to Staying Up Until 4 A.M.
