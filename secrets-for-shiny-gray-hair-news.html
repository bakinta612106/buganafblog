And now that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>you've gone gray</a>, your needs may change. "The best shampoo to look for is a purple-colored shampoo," says <strong>Cindy Marcus</strong>, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>professional hairstylist in Las Vegas</a> and editor-in-chief of Latest Hairstyles. "The purple tones help to keep gray hair from yellowing and enable white hair to remain white and vibrant."</p><p>If you have overly coarse or frizzy hair, you'll want to alternate between a purple shampoo and a hydrating shampoo. "In doing this, you are adding needed moisture back into the hair along with eliminating brassy tones," says Marcus. The same routine can be done with a volumizing shampoo if more fullness is needed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/blue-shampoo-bottle-.png><p>While you'll want to choose a colored shampoo, your conditioner should match your hair's specific needs. "For someone with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>coarse textured hair</a>, you would want to look for a conditioner that is hydrating or moisturizing," says Marcus. "Women with fine hair would benefit from a conditioner that provides fullness and volume<i>."&nbsp;</i>Ask your stylist if you need help deciding.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>If You're Over 65, This Hairstyle Is Aging You, Experts Say</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/blow-dry-grey-hair-.png><p>Now that you know how to wash your hair, it's important to know how often. Unfortunately, sudsing up several times a week can strip hair of the natural oils that are needed to keep it healthy and shiny. "For best results, it is advised to wash hair about once a week," says Marcus. Because this is a somewhat low frequency, Marcus suggests going to the salon once a week for a wash and blowout if you can. Adding a curl or two can help you maintain volume longer while going over the style with a flat iron can add a shiny effect, Marcus notes. The key here is that less is more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/heat-protectant-spray.png><p>Gray hair is more easily damaged by heat than hair that has not lost its pigment. Because of that, you'll want to be extra cautious when using hot tools. According to <b>Teresa Romero</b>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>artistic and education director</a> for Jose Luis Salon, this includes always using a heat protectant before using hot tools and using tools with a range of heat settings (and keeping the temperature low). You'll also want to move somewhat quickly. "Do not leave a hot tool on your hair for a long time," she says. "Pro tip: If the hair is too hot to touch with your finger, then it is too much heat for the hair."</p><p><strong>RELATED: For more beauty advice delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/older-woman-grey-hair-haircult.png><p><strong>Cody Renegar</strong>, an L.A.-based celebrity hairstylist whose clients include <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> and <strong>Marie Osmond</strong>, you'll want to trim gray hair frequently. "Gray hair is a tiny strand of microscopic bubbles when looked at under a microscope and those bubbles can easily fray and split on the ends causing the hair to actually break and frizz and become shorter," he says. "Keeping these ends nice and clean and crisp will keep the hair growing long and healthy." Most experts recommend trimming every eight to 10 weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/grey-hair-in-bun.png><p>Now that your hair is trimmed, washed, and styled, it's time to have fun! <b>Janine Jarman</b>, the owner of L.A.'s Hairroin Salon and founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.curlcult.com/&source=gmail&ust=1655994972354000&usg=AOvVaw1RFiQDnEj9eAbuZA-cVSiR">Curl Cult</a>, suggests fun barrettes, elastics, and claw clips.
