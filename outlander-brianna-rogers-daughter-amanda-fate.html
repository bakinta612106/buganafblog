During her pregnancy, she travels to Edenton with her husband Roger MacKenzie, who departs Fraser’s Ridge to become a pastor. A baby girl named Amanda Claire Hope MacKenzie is born to Bree in the second episode of the seventh season. However, Amanda only offers the Fraser family a glimmer of optimism until Claire discovers that she has a serious cardiac issue. She tells her daughter that Amanda’s condition is critical, leaving one to wonder if she will pass away. Here is all the information you need to know about the same, though! Spoilers follow.</p><h3>Will Brianna and Roger’s Daughter Amanda Die?</h3><p>Bree gives birth to a baby girl in the second episode of season 7 in front of her husband Roger, her father Jamie, and her mother Claire, who acts as a midwife to assist her daughter. Her parents, grandparents, and grandma all adore Amanda very much. Amanda’s birth radically changes the Fraser family’s fortunes after a string of setbacks. One day while caring for Amanda, Claire noticed blue stains on the infant’s fingernails. The nurse then determines that her granddaughter has a cardiac problem after listening to her heartbeats.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ols7-701sg-00-09-22-12-a-e1687545983864-1.jpg alt="outlander brianna actress,brianna outlander bad acting,outlander brianna and roger wedding night,outlander brianna death,does brianna die in outlander books,brianna and roger no chemistry,outlander brianna baby father,when does brianna go through the stones season 4,outlander roger and brianna,outlander brianna and roger child,outlander roger and brianna baby" width=1500 height=690 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The nurse explains that the infant has a heart problem that prevents the organ from pumping enough blood to the rest of the body while Bree, who is watching Claire listen to Amanda’s heartbeats, wonders what is wrong with her kid. Bree and Roger are forced to part ways with the family since Claire, who isn’t a heart surgeon, warns them that there is nothing more that can be done to rescue Amanda. Amanda travels to the 20th century in order for Bee, Roger, their son Jeremiah “Jem” MacKenzie, and Amanda to receive the necessary surgery and further care. Even if Amanda’s life is in danger, we might not have to worry about her for long.</p><p>Amanda doesn’t pass away, at least not in the ‘Outlander’ novels by Diana Gabaldon that serve as the series’ source materials. We have no reason to be concerned about the infant girl’s life in the <a href=#>historical drama</a> because the series is anticipated to faithfully adapt the <a href=#>books</a>. In ‘Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone,’ the ninth and last ‘Outlander’ book to be released, Amanda is still alive and well. We can expect that Amanda will live in the upcoming tenth book of the book series since the literature makes no mention of her life being in danger. So it is unlikely that Claire and Jamie will lose their deceased granddaughter.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ols7-701sg-00-39-04-13-a-1-e1687546360994-1.jpg alt="outlander brianna actress,brianna outlander bad acting,outlander brianna and roger wedding night,outlander brianna death,does brianna die in outlander books,brianna and roger no chemistry,outlander brianna baby father,when does brianna go through the stones season 4,outlander roger and brianna,outlander brianna and roger child,outlander roger and brianna baby" width=1500 height=701 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘An Echo in the Bone,’ the seventh ‘Outlander’ book, describes Amanda as a happy and creative young woman. She has a deep bond with her brother Jem, who is kidnapped by Rob Cameron, a coworker of Bree’s, and taken back in time. But soon Amanda and Jem get back together. Even the reunion of Jamie and Claire with their cherished granddaughter can be anticipated if the television show sticks to the storyline of the book series. Bree and her family travel back in time to be with her parents in the final chapter of “Go Tell the Bees That I Am Gone.” Finally, Amanda will be able to savour her time with both her grandmother and grandfather.</p><p>For Bree, Roger, and Jem’s travel to the 20th century, which is a crucial development in the later books of the “Outlander” novel series, Diana Gabaldon must have imagined Amanda’s heart problem. Bree and her family encounter a number of incidents while trying to save Amanda, which advance the plot of the novel series.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="outlander brianna actress,brianna outlander bad acting,outlander brianna and roger wedding night,outlander brianna death,does brianna die in outlander books,brianna and roger no chemistry,outlander brianna baby father,when does brianna go through the stones season 4,outlander roger and brianna,outlander brianna and roger child,outlander roger and brianna baby" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
