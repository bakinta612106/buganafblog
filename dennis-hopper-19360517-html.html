He attended the Actors Studio, made his first television appearance in 1954, and soon after appeared in Giant. In the next ten years he made a name in television, and by the end of the 1960s had appeared in several films, notably Cool Hand Luke and Hang 'Em High. Hopper also began a prolific and acclaimed photography career in the 1960s. Hopper made his directorial film debut with Easy Rider, which he and co-star Peter Fonda wrote with Terry Southern. The film earned Hopper a Cannes Film Festival Award for "Best First Work" and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Journalist Ann Hornaday wrote: "With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion".</p><table class=wikibox readability=11><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Dennis Lee Hopper, May 17, 1936, Dodge City, Kansas, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>May 29, 2010, Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>Jesús Nazareño Cemetery, Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Education</td><td class=wk_value>Helix High School</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Alma mater</td><td class=wk_value>Actors Studio</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actor, filmmaker, photographer, painter</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1954–2010</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Notable work</td><td class=wk_value>Filmography</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>4, including Ruthanna</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/dennis-hopper-wkrh-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Movie Actor Dennis Hopper was born in Dodge City, Kansas, United States on May 17, 1936.
