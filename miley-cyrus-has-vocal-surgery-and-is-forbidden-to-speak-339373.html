Approximately a month ago, Miley shocked fans when it was learned she had been hospitalized for tonsilitis. Her tonsils were removed and it seemed she had a successful recovery. According to reports, doctors discovered an undiagnosed vocal cord condition that needed to be treated through surgery. Miley was readmitted to the hospital earlier this week, underwent vocal surgery, and has since been released with the orders that she remains silent for several weeks so that she may heal.</p><p>People reported the following where they quoted sources who dished on Miley’s health.</p><p>“When Cyrus was hospitalized for tonsillitis last month, she discovered a separate issue with her vocal cords, which she had unknowingly had for years, according to sources. After learning of the issue, Cyrus was told she would need to have surgery before the end of the year, and that the recovery process would include several weeks of silence.”</p><p>Miley hasn’t written about the surgery on her Instagram account or shared any updates on her health and recovery.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Miley Cyrus 'had vocal surgery and will require weeks of silence' <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/zlL17k9qI5</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/jUME5Trv0T</a></p><p>— Mirror Celeb (@MirrorCeleb) <a href=# rel=nofollow>November 10, 2019</a></p><p>Though the reports suggest that Miley is doing well and recovering, many of her fans are concerned that she may have damaged her vocal cords permanently. Miley has seemed to be able to sing without any difficulty and she hasn’t had any slip-ups with her voice.</p><p>Still, many fans are continuing to worry about the 26-year-old “Wrecking Ball” singer and they are hoping she will still have her strong, singing voice after she is done healing and able to use her voice again.</p><p>Miley was in the process of recording new music and that is currently on hold until she is done healing.</p><p>Cody Simpson, Miley Cyrus’ boyfriend, has been devoted to the Grammy-winner singer since they started seeing each other.
