Walmart claims he’s sued previously over the same alleged incident.</p><p>“Mr. Jackson’s allegations are almost identical to a lawsuit he filed against our company in 2021 that was dismissed,” a spokesperson for the company wrote in a statement,&nbsp;<a href=#>according</a>&nbsp;to NBC News.</p><p>Roughly three years ago,&nbsp;Jackson claimed that he was a victim of racial profiling and false accusations that resulted in his arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>He told the court that he suffered emotional stress and pain from the handcuffs being placed on him when he was being arrested, and like the recent lawsuit, Jackson&nbsp;initially sought $100 million and&nbsp;“a huge credit for future shopping”&nbsp;but later revised the complaint to request $175 million in damages.</p><p>Court documents show his case was dismissed shortly after filing due to failure to properly serve Walmart.</p><p>Walmart maintains as a company it does not “tolerate discrimination of any kind.”</p><p>“We intend to defend the company against the allegations once we have been properly served,” the company said. “And will quickly ask the court to dismiss any claims&nbsp;that are without merit.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX91e49qZmpwX6myua3SZqSapl2sv7C6xp%2BspWWRmLC2v8SdZKieXai1sLzLop2toZ6ceritza2qZq%2BRobqivtNmq6hll57DpnnHoqRmaWBlunA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
