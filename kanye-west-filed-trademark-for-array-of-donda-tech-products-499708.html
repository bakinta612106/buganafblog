Check out the available message below.</p><p>The Shade Room said that ‘proving that he’s constantly working to add to his billionaire status, #KanyeWest now apparently has plans to take over the world of technology and he already has a list of ways to do it. Recent documents reveal that Kanye West has filed trademarks for a collection of “Donda” technology products that include everything from smartphones to tablets.’</p><p>TSR said that ‘@RollingStone reports, although he released his record-breaking album “Donda” that topped the charts a little over a month ago and just dropped his Yeezy x Gap hoodie collection, Kanye West is not slowing down at all. In his latest vision for his multi-billion empire, Ye has set his sights on conquering the world of tech—and he’s already filed trademarks to do so.’</p><p>TSR continued and said: ‘His Mascotte Holdings company (and subsidiary of Donda) filed a trademark application late last month via the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The products included in the trademark application include tablets, surround sound systems, headphones, virtual reality headsets, smartphones, USB flash drives and protective phone cases and other electronic equipment.’</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</p><p>TSR said that ‘That’s not all that Kanye is coming with, as additional products listed are smart bracelets, smart rings, smart necklaces, magnets and mouse pads. Reportedly, he is even looking to create a “Donda” screensaver and wallpaper game.’</p><p>One follower said: ‘He said he was going to be Steve Jobs and he meant it,’ and a commente rposted this: ‘This man is a genius . Often misunderstood but most trendsetters are.’</p><p>Another commenter posted this: ‘He’ll probably be successful in that too. Anything he tries he becomes successful in it,’ and a fan said: ‘I love to see it, How many black men are actually running the world? Kayne has the power I rather him then anyone else.’</p><p>A fan said the following: ‘Kanye may be a lot if things but he’s going to figure out any way POSSIBLE to make money,’ and a commenter said: ‘The tag line should be a sample from Donda Chant. Like a Mac makes that “DONG” sound, turn on a Ye Tablet and “DONDA”.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Someone else said: ‘There must be a tech company that needs branding. Great opportunity for Ye!’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblru6sYywnKysXZu2rbHDZqurmZSauqK%2BymadqKpdlr%2Bzrdhmpp9llKS7pa2MrZycoF2lv7Cw1JyrrGVkboZ4fJdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
