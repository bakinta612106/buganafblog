Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Matt Ox was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA, on 13 December 2004, so under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and holding American nationality – he is popular for his still youthful career of a rapper, while he is also a YouTuber.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_and_education>Childhood and education</span></h2><p>Matt has spent his entire childhood in the Lawncrest neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia. He prefers not to talk about the early years of his life, as his father committed suicide while Matt was still just a kid – his mother’s name is Laurel but her profession is not known. Matt appears to be an only child, as he hasn’t mentioned having any siblings.</p><p>Matt grew up listening to Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Marilyn Manson, and promised to himself that he was going to become a popular rapper one day. His uncle often went to a music studio and took Matt with him, which led Matt to start writing his own rap songs when he was around eight years old.
