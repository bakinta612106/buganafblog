The singer and <strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong> player were seen in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a photo</a>, apparently taken at the event, that was tweeted by a fan. Although only Travis’ back is shown, Taylor appears to be wearing the sweater as she stands in the snapshot and chats with fellow partygoers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Shortly after the tweet made its rounds, fans pointed out that the sweaters seem to reference Travis’ now-famous “squirle” tweet, which can be seen below. In the post, which was shared back in April 2011, the NFL star misspelled the word “squirrel” and “peice” as he admits to giving the animal bread during an outing.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just gave a squirle a peice of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!!

TAYLOR SWIFT?! TRAVIS KELCE?! WEARING MATCHING SQUIRREL SWEATERS?! AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY?!” one person exclaimed in a post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-national-tight-ends-day-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-game-embed-1.jpg><p dir=auto lang=en data-testid=tweetText>Since Taylor and Travis’ romance began, fans have been having fun digging up Travis’ old tweets and the squirrel ones was no exception. Although it’s not clear if the couple, in fact, wore the matching sweaters at the party, Taylor and Travis were joined by many others who did wear matching outfits, including Travis’ teammate <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> and his wife, <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong>, who showed off matching reindeer onesies, and other teammate <strong>Blake Bell&nbsp;</strong>and his wife, <strong>Lyndsey Bell</strong>, who showed off matching Christmas tree onesies, in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> Brittany shared.</p><p class="css-1rynq56 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" dir=ltr>Taylor and Travis’ latest holiday outing comes after she landed in the Kansas City area on her private jet just hours after her last Eras Tour show of 2023 last week. Since then, she made a brief trip to<strong> Beyonce</strong>‘s Renaissance Tour movie premiere in London, England and has reportedly been staying with Travis at his Kansas City mansion. It’s also been reported she’s expected to be cheering on her athlete beau during his Chiefs game against the<strong> Green Bay Packers</strong> in Wisconsin on Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZuupMCOrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BrZqyilsOqv4yknKWblWKutcDEp5tmoJ%2BhtqWt2GanmqqkrnqquoykmKerkah6pLXTsmSsnZWitq%2Bzy7JksJ2Rp3qurdOcn6Kml2LAssHIq6mepF2oxKat056prGWgnby1u44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
