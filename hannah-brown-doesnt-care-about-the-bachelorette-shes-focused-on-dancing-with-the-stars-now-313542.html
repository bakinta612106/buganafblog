The reality star is now heading off to compete in the 28th season of Dancing With The Stars.</p><p>During a conversation with reporters from People Magazine, Brown said that she was focused on herself and her life rather than the happenings with other shows and old relationships. Approximately five weeks after she got engaged to Jed Wyatt, it was revealed he was dating another woman at the time, so she and Jed broke it off.</p><p>Following this mishap, Hannah asked Cameron to go on a date, and fans of the reality stars were thrilled. Not long after, however, Taylor was spotted hanging around Gigi Hadid in New York City. Cameron and Gigi have since been photographed together on a number of occasions.</p><p>Hannah said to People Magazine that she was focused on competing and doing her best, rather than “flashing back” to the “pageant days.” She’s committed to improving every week, rather than worrying so much about what her competitors are doing.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0mQcVKH5ki/</p><p>Moving past her relationships, during a conversation with Hollywood Life, Hannah said she’s super excited about the fact she’s going to be able to become vulnerable in a way fans have never seen before. The star believes people have connected with her due to honesty and vulnerability, and she intends on showing off her personality in the same way.</p><p>“There is a lot more to me,” Hannah added, “and I want to be able to share that.” The reality star is looking forward to letting people see that she has a lot more to offer yet.</p><p>According to Brown, there is a purpose in feeling emotional pain, as well as power. The reality star explained that one can find strength in weaknesses, and in many cases, people, unfortunately, try to shy away from it, even though that’s where the most personal growth comes from.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Hannah said people are concerned with only showing their best moments, especially on social media, but inspiration and growth come from feeling and showing pain as well.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeYlruvrcdmmaunp6N6pbvErKWtZZOWv6Z5wJumrqxdqbWmecGamqGdnKS%2FpsDTnmSsoJWoeqe7wq6qnpxdpLtusMCnmqKml2LEqsDHZquhnV2owaK%2B0malqK9daH50gZNrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
