Cousins' $100 million in guaranteed money will consist of $90 million in 2024 and 2025, then the remaining $10 million in 2026.</p><p>If he plays out the contract and earns all $180 million, his career earnings will be just over $411.6 million (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotrac</a>).</p><p>While Cousins has earned four Pro Bowl nods throughout his career, that's a surprisingly large amount for a signal-caller who has only appeared in five playoff games and owns a record of 76-67-2 as a starter since he entered the NFL in 2012.</p><p>After starting his career in Washington, Cousins received a three-year contract worth $84 million from the Vikings in 2018. Two seasons later, he agreed to a two-year extension with the organization totaling $66 million. He also earned another $30 million during his final season with Minnesota in 2023, per Spotrac.</p><p>Atlanta is taking a risk by signing Cousins, as he's coming off a season-ending torn Achilles that he suffered in Week 8. He'll also be 36 years old at the beginning of the 2024 regular season.</p><p>Still, he threw for 2,331 yards and 18 touchdowns compared to just five interceptions in eight starts prior to the injury. If Cousins bounces back strong, he should help the Falcons as they look to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWeDcX2MpKCro12YvLa%2FyKeqZqaWoXqkrdGenKtllZa%2Fr7XNoKpmmZapsrN5wKCpnp2Zo7RuwM5mqZ6on6fBprCMam9ppV2brq2vzqeqZpufo8GzrcKt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
