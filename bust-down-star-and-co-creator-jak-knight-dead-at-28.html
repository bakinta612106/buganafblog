The series follows a group of friends and co-workers at dead-end jobs in a Gary, Indiana casino. He played a stockroom worker also named “Jak.”</p><p>From the first episode, which Knight wrote and executive produced, fans fell in love with his scene-stealing shenanigans. The keep-it-real and raunchy series showcased his impeccable timing, brilliant writing, and slapstick physical comedy.</p><p>The Seattle native most recently appeared in <strong>Chelsea Peretti’s </strong>upcoming first feature film as a director,&nbsp;<strong>First Time Female Director</strong>.</p><h2>Before&nbsp;Bust Down</h2><p>What do <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Black-ish</strong></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Big Mouth </strong>and<strong> Pause With Sam Jay </strong>have in common?

In a 2018 interview, Knight talked to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Respect</strong></a> about working and writing alongside dozens of the biggest names in comedy on the Netflix animated series.</p><p>“Being a writer is amazing and just being in the room with some of the most brilliant people alive, and I get to sit across the table with people like <a id=auto-tag_jordan-peele href=# rel=noopener data-tag=jordan-peele><strong>Jordan Peele</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a id=auto-tag_maya-rudolph href=# rel=noopener data-tag=maya-rudolph>Maya Rudolph</a></strong>,” he shared. “It’s surreal but it’s a lot of work, work.”</p><p>He went on to work on&nbsp;Black-ish as a writer and executive story editor in 2019. Last year, he wrote for all ten episodes of Bill Burr’s dark comedy anthology, <strong>Immoral</strong><strong>&nbsp;Compass.&nbsp;</strong>Knight flexed his dynamic comedy skills on both sides of the camera on HBO’s Pause With Sam Jay as an actor, writer, and co-executive producer.</p><h2>Stand-Up Legend In The Making</h2><p>Comedy Central named Knight a Face To Watch in 2014.
