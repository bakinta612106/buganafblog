The school's provost Forrest Maltzman released a statement (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Kilgore and Gene Wang</a> of the Washington Post) to address the situation:</p><p class=ui-droppable><span>The university concluded that Coach Lonergan had engaged in conduct inconsistent with the university's values.</span></p><p class=ui-droppable><span><span>The university has created and is committed to maintaining a community where all students, faculty and staff feel welcome and comfortable.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kilgore</a>, one player alleged that Lonergan was "<span>denigrating players and making repeated graphic remarks about the school's athletic director."</span></p><p><span><span>"According to multiple players, Lonergan's critiques crossed the line from constructive to mean-spirited," Kilgore wrote in July. "He told one player his son would always be on food stamps. He told another, in front of the team, he should transfer to a 'transgender league,' multiple players said."</span></span></p><p><span><span>Kilgore also reported that a source close to a former Colonials player said "he 'went through hell' <span>playing for Lonergan because of constant personal comments and critiques. One former player said he attended therapy and considered quitting basketball because of Lonergan’s language and actions toward him."</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>After the allegations surfaced, George Washington announced it had hired outside counsel to conduct an investigation regarding Lonergan's actions.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>"Some of the reported allegations go beyond the scope of Title IX, and the university is bringing in outside counsel to assist in its investigation," the school said in a statement, per the Washington Post's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Des Bieler</a>.
