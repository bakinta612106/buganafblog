She had a successful cookbook. And then, Boom, line at Target. Boom, she now has an Instagram page which has over a million followers where it is just, like, other people running a content farm for her. That horrifies me and it is not something I ever want to do. I do not aspire to that. But like, who is laughing now? Because she is making a ton of f***ing money.’</p><p>Soon after, Chrissy took to her Twitter account to clap back at Alison.</p><p>The Cravings author wrote that: ‘This is a huge bummer and it hit me hard. I’ve made her recipes for years, bought her cookbooks, supported her on social media and praised her during interviews. I even signed on to executively produce the show she talks about doing in the article.’</p><p>She made sure to defend her website against the accusation that it is a ‘content farm,’ stressing that she simply started it so she would have something that husband, John Legend did not buy for her – something all hers that made her and others happy.</p><p>Chrissy insisted that the site’s content is not ‘farmed’ and that only she and other two women work on publishing content.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘I didn’t ‘sell-out’ by making my dreams come true. To have a cookware line, to get to be a part of that process start to finish, to see something go from sketch to in my hands, I love that,’ the mother of two also tweeted.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv9KyZK2dmZyyr3nCpZipq12XrqS3jJqrZp6fpLFuw9Giq56qXZm%2ForPGoqWgZZiav260zqupop6pnruoecKopqShnpx6prnPoqmeZWNugnKBk2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
