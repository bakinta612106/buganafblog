Uh, facial hair isn’t really my thing. I don’t grow it very well. That was a good two months of commitment.”</p><p>Even then, he needed some help. “Yeah, there was a little bit of makeup… to make it look a little thicker, but the real Don Piper had a pretty hefty mustache,” baby <strong>Briar Rose’</strong>s dad mused of his character. “It wasn’t necessarily my thing, it itched a lot. I’m very happy to shave it off.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=291 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Hayden Christensen with Moustache" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>His longtime girlfriend Bilson was just as relieved, he revealed to HuffPost. “She was very happy for me to get rid of it. But yeah, it’s the character,” he explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Christensen portrays Piper in the film adaptation of the pastor’s 2004 New York Times best-selling book. In his memoir, Piper detailed his near-death experience in heaven after a scary car crash, in which he was pronounced dead on the scene after his heart stopped beating.</p><p>The actor also opened up to Us Weekly last week about why he chose this particular role.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I read the script, and I was very affected by the story,” Christensen told <strong>Us</strong> at the premiere of the film in Atlanta, Ga. “I was a fan of the filmmaker, Michael Polish, I think is a real artist, and his wife, Kate Bosworth is a very talented actress, and I wanted to see her in this role. The character she plays is such an amazing character, and she’s really the hero of the story, and I just wanted to be a part of a movie that was part of telling a good story.”</p><p>Watch the video above!</p><p><strong>Have a question you’d like to ask a celebrity?
