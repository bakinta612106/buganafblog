Simple: we needed to be in a place where we could feel safer and live more peacefully,” the actress, now 80, recalled of often feeling targeted by robbers because of her immense collection of valuables.</p><p>While visiting New York in the fall of 1970, Sophia was once robbed at gunpoint in her hotel room while her young son, Carlo Jr. (nicknamed Cipi), then just two-years-old, was sleeping.</p><p><a href=#>Related Story: Brooke Shields Opens Up About Her Abusive Mother & Troubled Childhood in a New Memoir</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sophia-loren-jewelry.jpg> Sophia wearing earrings and a necklace by Van Cleef and Arpels at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1966.
