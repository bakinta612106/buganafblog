In the talked-about papers, the former Full House star sought ownership of the couple's 2000 Toyota Avalon, as well as an even split of their $200 Kohl's credit card balance.</p><p>Sweetin also asked for full custody of the couple's 2-year-old daughter <strong>Beatrix</strong>. The former child star took to Twitter on Tuesday to thank fans for their support, and to <a href=#>address the reports head-on</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Thank you to everyone for being kind and supportiveâ€¦I really appreciate all the fan love," she tweeted. "Life can have its challenges, for sure!"</p><p>At Tuesday night's jam session, Coyle similarly kept talk of the separation brief, only telling a pal that he had read about news of their separation online earlier that day.</p><p>Sweetin and Coyle tied the knot in a private ceremony in March 2012, and only revealed the details of their nuptials on their one-year anniversary, on March 15, 2013. This is Sweetin's third marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGonJmaerTDxJ6roqajYrK0wNGapaCdlGK1tr%2FBmqWdZZ2kv7XFjJymsqSVYr2mvsWoqaarXZaztbHRZqqeqJGnrrW1zqdkZmpgZoBzgpU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
