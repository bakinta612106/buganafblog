"We will always remember Kerry fondly," the British TV personality wrote in his column. "He was a gentle man who will be missed greatly. He was still young and handsome at 60 years of age. He didnâ€™t smoke or drink alcohol, preferring his favorite juices regimen."</p><p>Chicago-born Simon, who was given his rock n' roll nickname by Rolling Stone, solidified his celebrity chef status after winning a 2005 episode of Iron Chef. Also a successful restaurateur, he owned several restaurants in locations including Vegas, L.A., and Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p><p>In a 2010 interview with <a href=#>Haute Living</a>, Simon dished some details about his work ethic, explaining that he wanted every item on his menu to be amazing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"For example, chicken wings (at CatHouse). I must have spent three months developing them. I know it sounds silly but I went through so many different processes over chicken wings and it just went on and on," he said. "At the end of it all, it is all about hard work. I study everything and look at everything that is going on. I read everything from newspapers to food magazines to cookbooks. That plays the biggest role in what I do."</p><p>Simon, who grew up wanting to be a rock star, kicked off his culinary career back when <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s first wife, <strong>Ivana</strong>, tasked him with running the Plaza Hotel's Edwardian Room in the late '80s. Eventually, Simon moved on and up, working under world-renowned French chef <strong>Jean-Georges Vongerichten</strong>.</p><p>Reflecting back on his rise to the top, Simon told Haute Living in the same interview: "One thing if you look at my career through the years, I have taken a lot of gambles, some which were not so great, some that were very great. I [am a] very searching, spiritual person so there is something that happens through everything I have done, whether it has been the lowest part of my career or the highest part of my career, that has some sort of relativeness to that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCrp55isKmxxWaqrZmiYrGmrdOhZKSdoqfGbr%2FIpqanZZSesrR5wK1kb2hdm7%2BwuYymqpplYmV%2Bdn2Qcg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
