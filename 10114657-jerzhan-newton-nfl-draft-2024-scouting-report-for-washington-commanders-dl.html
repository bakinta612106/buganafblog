He's strong and stout at the point of attack against the run to stun offensive linemen and stay in his gap. He also has little to no issues getting off blocks and can make plays outside of his gap with his impressive blend of strength and athleticism.</p><p>As a pass-rusher, Newton has very active hands to "beat the hands, beat the man" and add to his pass-rush repertoire. He has a handful of moves he can win with around the edges and has impressive bend for a defensive tackle. He's also flashed some athleticism/agility to be an effective looper in line games and continues to grow as a rusher.</p><p>The Illinois product does lack ideal size for an NFL defensive tackle, and it bears watching how he measures in at the combine, as he appears to have shorter arms. His smaller stature does limit his bull rush and ability to hold ground against double-teams, as well as limiting how much extension he can get.</p><p>Ultimately, Newton brings a lot to the table as a pass-rusher and run defender to be worthy of a first-round pick. He'd be best as a 3-technique in even fronts but could play as a defensive end (4i- to 5-technique) in odd fronts.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 8.0 (Year 1 Starter — Late 1st/Early 2nd Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 20</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: DL2</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Sheldon Richardson</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmDdoOMo5yrspiWu266xLCrqKZdo7OtecOrmJ%2BsXWd9c4CMrJqoraSeu6h50Z6nqKqkYrOwvoywmKygmaO0tbvNZpqopZ2Wu6Wx0axknaQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
