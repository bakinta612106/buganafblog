That being said, model Miranda Kerr took to social media to congratulate her ex-husband, <a href=# title="Orlando Bloom Posts Emotional Message About His Missing Dog">Orlando Bloom</a> for welcoming a baby girl with his current significant other, fiancée, Katy Perry!</p><p>Not only that but she also expressed excitement over the idea that she’d get to meet her at some point, insisting that she ‘can’t wait’ for that day to come already!</p><p>It appears that ‘Auntie Miranda Kerr’ is looking forward to showering the bundle of joy with love and affection in person as well, not just online!</p><p>Before this response from Miranda, her former husband, actor Orlando Bloom, announced his singer fiancée had given birth.</p><p>Furthermore, he also revealed the baby girl’s name – Daisy Dove– writing ‘Welcome to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom!’</p><p>Soon after, many fans but also fellow celebs began flooding his comment section with congratulatory comments and Miranda Kerr was amongst them!</p><p>The stunning model with whom Orlando shares a son, wrote: ‘I’m so happy for you guys [heart emoji, praying hands, emoji and rainbow emoji] Can’t wait to meet her.’</p><p>There is no doubt that some people might find her message odd, purely because of the fact that ex wives rarely gush over their former husbands’ new babies with other women!</p><p>However, there is no secret that Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom have a really good relationship even now – about 7 years after their divorce.</p><p>With that in mind, it does not seem that strange anymore that Miranda Kerr was gushing over her ex’s new baby.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Back in 2013 when they were divorcing, Orlando stressed via the Los Angeles Times that ‘We love each other. We are a family. We are going to be in each other’s lives for the rest of our lives. There is no question, for the sake of our son and everything else, we are going to support one another and to love each other as parents to Flynn. Life sometimes does not work out exactly as we plan or hope for, but fortunately, we are both adults.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGefp7miusOoZJukn6S6tHnFqKmmnaJixKqyxGakqJyVoXqutdGapZ2ZXaCys76MoKysoJWoerDCxKtkoaGjYrumw4ybmJuxXay2tbSMpJitsV2lsrO%2B2GaamqakYsSitdNmq6hlnZqytXnHnqlmbGNmgniDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
