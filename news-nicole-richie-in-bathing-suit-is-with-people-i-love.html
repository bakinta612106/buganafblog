"Everyone's doing a million things, and we have to realize that self-care and rest is just as important, and you have to have that in order to be the best version of yourself," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Self</span></a><span>. She starts getting ready for bed at 7:01. "I started that when my kids were young and they used to go to bed at seven. My friends would call me at 7:01, because that's when I started to turn down. Now [my kids] don't go to bed at 7 p.m., but I'm definitely trying to. So I start my routine with, well, it used to be tea. Now that has turned into wine. I'm very into Avaline wine right now. I just like to have a glass, a little splash of that, and get on the couch, watch some episodes of Yellowstone."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1353252644.jpg><p><span>One of Richie's self-care routines is taking a bath with Epsom. "Joel's mom lives in Maryland, and she lives close to an Amish community. This community makes my favorite handmade soaps. So she sends me those soaps, and those are the soaps that I use at night in the bath. They're great," she told Self.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1269758098.jpg><p><span>"The number one thing I tell myself I have to do every day is stretch," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Zoe Report</span></a><span> during the pandemic. "I'm on Zooms all day, sitting down, I'm not moving as much, and it's definitely harder to be active. For me, the most important thing to do is to stretch."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nicole likes cooking, especially "shortcut meals," which are healthy, nutritious, and easy to make. "I do a lot of overnight oats, lasagna, slow-cooker chicken tacos, and quesadillas," She told TZR. "I like making things that will last."</span></p><p><span>When it comes to wellness, Nicole has one suggestion. "Spend time outdoors," she revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Chalkboard Mag</span></a><span>. "There's an abundance of hiking trails, beaches and opportunities to exercise and be outdoors," she explained. She also takes workout classes.

Her favorite is Pressed Juicery greens 5 with fennel and cilantro, she revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Chalkboard Mag</span></a><span>. She even manages to slip in a nutritious juice when drinking alcohol. When asked what her favorite cocktail was she responded, "Shot of tequila with a Pressed Juicery citrus 2 chaser, baby!"</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkp6GTpLmmedGimqGhlWK2r3nBmquhoZ6cerTByK1koqtdrLa1tIypnKionJp6qnnLqK2eZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
