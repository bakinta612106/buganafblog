In a 36-second clip, Harvey and the actor can be seen posing for the cameras while one photographer yells, “Lori, you look fantastic.” Another tells the pair to come forward as Idris looks to Lori and begins speaking. It’s unclear exactly what she said but it appeared to be something funny as the SKN by LH founder began laughing and showing her pearly white teeth.</p><p>The British entertainer then began slowly backing away from her while holding out his hand to her. “Lori, let’s get a quick single, Lori,” yells another cameraman from behind the video.</p><p>Harvey quickly tapped in, striking poses while different cameras continued capturing her beauty solo.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Damson Idris and Lori Harvey Arrive At Snowfall Season 6 Premiere <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/udGBDY99rZ</a></p>— WHEREISTHEBUZZ (@whereisthebuzz) <a href=#>February 16, 2023</a></figure><p>“They standing as if, if this don’t work out they can crop each other out the picture and still keep it,” wrote one fan on Twitter.</p><p>“That’s exactly what it’s giving.

Since then they’ve set Instagram ablaze with subtle photos on Harvey’s personal page. For Valentine’s Day, the “Farming” star penned a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sweet letter</a> to Steve Harvey’s stepdaughter to celebrate spending the last few months as a couple.</p><p>“I realized the day it has been exactly 100 days since your beautiful silver dress. Thank God for that dance,” Idris wrote on the Cartier card, paired with roses. “Every day since with you by my side has been my favorite movie. I can’t wait til we hit 1000 months. Happy Valentine’s Day baby. I love you. LUURVE.”</p><p>Fans speculate the silver dress he referred to is likely the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">monochrome outfit</a> Harvey wore to Odell Beckham Jr.’s 30th birthday party last November. She was spotted in a group photo with Idris, Beckham, Justine Skye, Kendall Jenner, Hailey Beiber, and friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49rZmpvX5m2pXnLqKmiZZiWv7ex2Gadq52Vr7Juu9StZJ2Znai8r3nInamiq12ku26%2Fzaiun5mcoXqxvsSmoJ6qlWK%2FprCMnJirqJWpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
