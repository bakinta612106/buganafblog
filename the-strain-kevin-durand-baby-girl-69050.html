Why? Because the show’s biggest stars, Leah Remini and Kevin James, are set to appear on-screen together again. So, to answer your question, yes, <a href=#>Leah is joining Kevin Can Wait this fall</a>.</p><p>The 47-year-old actress confirmed the news back in early June with an Instagram post that read, “Dreams do come true #Blessed #Grateful.” Leah previously appeared as a guest star on a few episodes of Season 1, but fans loved the KOQ reunion so much, that they decided to make her a regular for the second season of Kevin’s popular sitcom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/leah-remini-kevin-james-kevin-can-wait.jpg><p>Leah and Kevin on <i>Kevin Can Wait</i>.</p><p>She <a href=#>previously gushed about her role on the upcoming season</a> during a visit to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “At the end of his first season, I played [Kevin’s] ex-partner. We were cops together, we were detectives together. So I just come back as that character,” Leah said of playing Vanessa. “I loved [being reunited with Kevin]. It’s an amazing feeling.”</p><p>Turns out, Leah and Kevin never gave up on their friendship even though King of Queens ended 10 years ago. “We’re always in touch. She’s in my life forever. I can’t get rid of her!” Kevin previously joked to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. Leah added, “We’ve seen each other. It was cool reuniting the two characters.”</p><p>That said, Leah’s decision to join the show for good was an easy one. “I got a call: ‘Do you want to do some more episodes?’ I said, ‘Yeah, of course, anything,'” she shared. “They said, ‘Okay, so you’re going to be doing all the episodes.’ I was like, ‘What?! For Kevin, anything.” We can’t wait to see the TV duo back in action during the Season 2 premiere of Kevin Can Wait come Monday, Sept. 25!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9OhnGarpKeuqrqMpJyvoZ5isba%2BwKebZpqRl8Zus8iro2ZuaWWCcQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
