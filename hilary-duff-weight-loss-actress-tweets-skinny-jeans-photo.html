Gabe Johns you’re kickin my ass and its paying off!” The caption read along with the skinny jeans pic. “Skinny jeans! Lets go!”</p><p>After realizing it would take a lot of work and a lot of time to get her body back to the way it was previous to getting pregnant, she called on the help of Los Angeles-based personal trainer and boxing instructor Gabe Johns. She has been working with the butt kicking fitness trainer for about two and half months and is already seeing some amazing results.</p><p>Of course, she is ready to take as long as needed to get her flat tummy back.</p><p>“It takes your body nine months to get there – really 10 months. So I’m trying to be patient but I’m working hard,” said the Lizzie McGuire star. “And I think now more than ever, I appreciate my body and what it’s done for me.”</p><p>The new mommy went on to admit that she feels like mothers who bounce back so quickly after pregnancy are “freaks of nature!”</p><p>Duff gave birth to Luca back in March with hockey star Mike Comrie. She did immediately try to lose weight right after the birth but didn’t see the amazing results right away the same way she has with her new trainer.</p><p>“Hilary and Gabe have been doing everything from boxing to two-a-day workouts incorporating wind sprints and jump roping in an effort to finally shed the baby weight,” Gabe’s rep revealed. “Hilary’s been steadily dropping pounds each week.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX5ze5BrZmlsX522ra3RsmSdrZaberixyKCfrWWcpMC0ecCcq6udo6h6tcPEnqusZaOgtq%2B62GahnpmeqHqxtM6tpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
