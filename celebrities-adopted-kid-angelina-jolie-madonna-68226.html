For someone like <a href=#><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></a>, adoption was always her “first choice” when it came to expanding her family.</p><p>“I was always aware that there are so many children in this world who don’t have families,” the Atomic Blonde actress, who is a <a href=#>proud mom to kids Jackson and August</a>, once said on <a href=#>Today</a>. “Adoption is a very personal thing — I know people whom I love dearly who don’t feel that they could raise another child as their own. I respect that. But for me — and I can’t be the only person out there — I never saw a difference in raising an adopted child versus my own biological child. I don’t feel like I’m missing out on something.”</p><p>In fact, Angelina has also spoken out about the joy of adoption. “All adopted children come with a beautiful mystery of a world that is meeting yours,” she previously told <a href=#>Vogue</a>. “When they are from another race and foreign land, that mystery, that gift, is so full. For them, they must never lose touch with where they came from.”</p><p><a href=#>Angelina shares her adopted children, Pax, Zahara and Maddox, with Brad</a>. The couple are also parents to their three biological kids, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox. Like Angelina, Sandra has learned about the beauty of adoption from raising <a href=#>her two kids, Laila and Louis</a>, with boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Bryan Randall</strong></a>.</p><p>During an interview on Today, the mother of two revealed why being a mom makes her so happy. “I finally realize, ‘Oh this is what I was supposed to do when I grew up,’” she said. “This is my purpose, and I knew it at a very young age … I felt that calling at a very young age, but I had to become the mom that I was supposed to be for the kids that were waiting for me.”</p><p><strong>Click through the gallery below to see Charlize, Angelina, Sandra and more stars who have adopted kids!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8Keo56aop7BqrHSZpidp6CpsqV5yqKbZpmenLKttc2aZKOnnJ6ybrnAnaanppFig3l%2BkW9mqaCfqby0e8KhmKukma%2BybsDHnqmopl2frqS30qilZmlhZYFxgQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
