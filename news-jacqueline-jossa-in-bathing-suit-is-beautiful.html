She says that she wanted to do this to help her feel better, not to lose weight. "I'm having those thoughts of 'I need to start doing a bit for me and I'm going to try and go for walks and maybe do some exercise,'" she started. "And no, before everyone pipes up it's not to necessarily lose weight, I wouldn't mind it, but it is more just to know that you're doing something. Because work-wise I'm feeling really good, I'm busy, I'm on the ball, and I just want to maintain that, and I feel like getting on the ball with it now, it's got to be done."</span></p><p><span>Jossa revealed some of her wellness secrets to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>Heatworld</span></a><span>. She says that even with her busy schedule, she always makes time for herself. Jossa says she sets one day aside a week to relax, and revealed some of the things she enjoys doing. "I would definitely put the phone away, watch a film maybe, definitely have a bath, exfoliate, smother myself in all the oils, moisturisers, body creams, hair mask, face mask, tan you name it, absolutely everything."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/GettyImages-1344509831.jpg><p><span>When it comes to Instagram, Jossa says that she only follows accounts that make her feel good. She tells Heatworld that this helps with her confidence, and prevents her from comparing herself to others. "I should just unfollow if it's not filling me with joy. So I just unfollow it. And because there are some people in the world that love to see all that because they have the ambition to be like them, but I don't. And you start feeling better. I follow people that are more inspiring to me and make me feel better. I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, she looks amazing in that dress and she's a size 16 and looks unreal'. I then think, 'I'm actually quite fit! She's fit, I'm fit' and I feel better about myself."</span></p><p><span>With Jossa, what you see is what you get. She tells Heatworld that she always wants to show her real life on Instagram. "I want to be the person on social media that other people go to and enjoy following you," she says. "You get your rolls out when you can, you don't edit your photos to extremes and you show yourself with no make-up on from time to time."</span></p><p><span>Jossa says that she is always comfortable with her body. She tells Heatworld, "You always beat yourself up so much and it's like, 'actually no, honey, you're still really really fit, you ain't getting no better!' You're gonna get older and it's gonna get worse for you, hun. Embrace it right now. Be in every picture with your kids because you'll regret it. They won't ever say, 'mummy, you look a bit fat there, or mummy, you've got a little roll hanging there' They never say that. They're gonna go, 'I remember that day, we went to the beach, it was so good'. This is gonna get deep but one day, the photo is all they're going to have so you got to make sure you're in them all."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko5mTpsKmuMinnGain6jAonnIp2SbmaSdtq%2BzjKysoqxdnsBursSarK2hlqq5cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
