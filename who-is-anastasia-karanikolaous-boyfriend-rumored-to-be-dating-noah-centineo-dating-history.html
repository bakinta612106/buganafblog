Rumors Explain</h2><p>Many people assumed he was bi when he posted a picture of himself kissing his closest friend, Chase Austin, on the lips in 2017.&nbsp;He ultimately removed the photograph, but many saw it as evidence of his homosexuality.&nbsp;In his post, he underlined that their connection was platonic and that being thus close to someone was not improper.&nbsp;Kiss your friends’ faces more often, and let go of the notion that intimacy is reserved for monogamous partnerships, he said. Be gentler with others. VALUE PLATONIC INTIMACY.</p><p>Accept your vulnerability.
