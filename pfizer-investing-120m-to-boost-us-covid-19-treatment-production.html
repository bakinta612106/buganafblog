Health officials have acknowledged that in the early days after it was authorized in December, supply was limited and many doctors were reluctant to prescribe for all but the highest-risk patients. &nbsp;</p><p>After efforts to get the word out about expanded supply and availability, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha touted last week that there are now 30,000 prescriptions for the treatment per day in the U.S. &nbsp;</p><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Buttigieg tests positive for COVID</a><br><a href=# class=thehill-promo-link__link rel=noopener><br>Navy identifies fighter pilot killed in California crash</a><br><p>Paxlovid is seen as a key part of making COVID-19 more manageable, given that the treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by around 90 percent. &nbsp;</p><p>To date, Pfizer has shipped 12 million courses globally to 37 countries, including five million to the U.S., the company said. &nbsp;</p><p>“By increasing production at our Michigan facility, we are both helping patients around the world and expanding important manufacturing innovation to the U.S,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8eemKWsmGK7psPSaKefoaqav261za%2BcrKyZo7RufZFppGasn2KvsLvSrWSuq12YvLe1w2ZocmWkp7KiwMyepa1loKe8pcHCraCopl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
