Fans were crestfallen to learn late Friday that the American Idol judge, TV producer, radio host and red carpet star, 38, had parted ways with <a href=#><strong>Julianne Hough </strong></a>after two years of dating. But those close to the couple tell Us Weekly that the breakup was inevitable, given Seacrest's steadfast commitment to his many, many professional obligations.</p><p>"Dude works all the time," a pal tells Us Weekly. "He never sleeps." Although dancer-turned-actress Hough, 24, has an increasingly hectic slate of projects herself, her priorities were a little different, the friend explains.</p><p>"It's a lifestyle she couldn't handle anymore. Work always, always came first [for Ryan] She wants a more lowkey life."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Three days before Valentine's Day, Hough told Us she still got "giddy" when she saw her guy on the small screen. "It was super exciting to see my man on TV. I was so proud of him," she said at an NYC screen of Safe Haven of Seacrest's red carpet stint before the Grammys in L.A. "I flew in from Nashville — I was at my sister's baby shower — and I walked in right as he was on and he looked so hot. He looked so cute!"</p><p>She also hinted that it wasn't easy for them to get together while she shot Safe Haven with Josh Duhamel last year in North Carolina. "We were working really hard, so we were really focused, but he came by a few times."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmymZ5iwKatwqucrKxdn8KttcCnpZ5lmKTCqLSMm6memZtiwrF50qGcZpufqrmlutNmn5qmlKGybrTIrGSnp56owbC8jLCmq6NdqLCpscOuo55lYmV%2BdH2VbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
