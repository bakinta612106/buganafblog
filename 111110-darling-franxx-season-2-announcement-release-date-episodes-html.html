While the anime had excellent reviews and was watched by millions of people globally, people are still hopeful that there will be a season 2. Being a <a href=#>co-production</a> between Studio Trigger and CloverWorks, there are high chances that either of them will go ahead with the season 2 production.

Nevertheless, <i>Darling in the Franxx </i>has not released any commutation on the scheduled release date. That leaves the fans with the option of being patient.
