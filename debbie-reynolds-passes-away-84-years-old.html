She passed away just yesterday. Debbie was at her son’s home&nbsp;making funeral arrangements for her daughter when the 911 call was made.</p><p>Debbie,&nbsp;84, has been starring&nbsp;in television and&nbsp;film since the early 1950’s. One of her most noteworthy and well known&nbsp;roles to date was Aggie Cromwell in the three&nbsp;Halloweentown movies. Other big parts for her&nbsp;include Tammy in Tammy and the Bachelor&nbsp;and Bobbi on the show&nbsp;Will and Grace.&nbsp;She also acted on Broadway, released a pop album, and had her own sitcom, which she received a Golden Globe nomination for. In 1964, she starred in&nbsp;The Unsinkable Molly Brown, and went on to receive an Academy Awards nomination for it.</p><p>Debbie&nbsp;released a semi-autobiography titled&nbsp;Postcards From the Edge in 1987, which was adapted into a film in 1990. The movie starred Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine, and focused greatly on Debbie’s&nbsp;relationship with her daughter.</p><p>Debbie, like her daughter, was a huge mental health advocate and acted as president of The Thalians, an organization dedicated to mental health causes. She also founded the Debbie Reynolds Dance Studio in West Hollywood and owned a Vegas casino.</p><p>Her son, Todd Fisher, tells the media, “she’s with Carrie.”</p><p>All of us here at CelebMix are sending our thoughts and prayers to Carrie and Debbie’s families.
