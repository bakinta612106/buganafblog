The second photo showed Keziah when she appeared to be just a few days old, in the NICU, being held by her mother with a tube coming out of her mouth.</p><p>In the caption, Fantasia wrote, “My Baby went from the NICU Baby to this Four Month Old Healthy Baby 🥲🤗🙏🏾 to God Be The Glory For All The Things He Has Done, I’m praising His Name all the Day Long🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 “””””””””𝑯𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒚 4 𝑴𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒉𝒔 𝑻𝒐𝒅𝒂𝒚 𝑲𝒆𝒛𝒛𝒚 𝑩𝒆𝒂𝒓””””””””””””.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pjimage-87-1-600x500.jpg><p>Fans complimented Keziah on her growth under her mother’s before-and-after post. One person said, “Oh she is so beautiful,” and another added, “Look at this little cute baby! God is Good!! ❤️.” Another simply put, “Cuteness overload 😍.”</p><p>Since she’s been pregnant with Keziah, the “When I See You” singer has centered many of her recent Instagram posts around her child. She not only had difficulty conceiving her, but also she gave birth to her prematurely.</p><p>Barrino and Taylor, who’ve been married for six years now, opened up about their fertility struggles on “The Tamron Hall Show” just weeks after announcing their pregnancy. They revealed that this process had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three years</a> in the making and eventually they decided to stop trying and to just let it happen naturally.</p><p>Some time had passed, and Barrino said, “I kid you not, I forgot about it … And then I woke up one night, and I was just like, ‘Um, something’s different.’” That’s when she took six pregnancy tests and confirmed they were having a baby. But Barrino gave birth seven months into the pregnancy, and her child had to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stay</a> in NICU for a month.</p><p>Now it appears the little one is bringing her parents nothing but joy. Barrino has two other children from previous relationships, and her husband has an adult son from a former relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49yZmtsX5uur8DArKCaZZKWv7O1zahkrKCRp7K0ecGenaiqlWKur7CMmp2tnaJivam706iqZqeWYrWmvoydmK6fmKmys3nFqKyrZZ2ku7W00maYn6yVp3qjrcGyqmaqlaGyor%2FEZp2rp51iu6qv1Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
