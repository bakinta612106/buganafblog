In the immediate hours following Chumpy’s accident, a close friend gently floated the idea of sperm retrieval. With the support of Chumpy’s family, it wasn’t a question of ‘if’ but ‘how’.”</p><p>She told Vogue that local guidelines required them to retrieve the sperm within 36 hours of his death. And even then, there were a host of specialists and lawyers she had to speak with in order to use his sperm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/10/29/4edcdadd-c1f8-4714-b9ac-86709b4e99f9/thumbnail/620x351/381b64252c2797b7d322a16566935584/gettyimages-524403500.jpg#><p>“It’s only with the benefit of time, that I truly understand the enormous amount of effort my family, friends, lawyers, and doctors put in, in those critical hours after Chump passed away, to give me the opportunity to continue our dream of starting a family,” she said.</p><p>Ellidy Pullin’s first round of IVF, which she began in December, wasn’t successful, she told Vogue. But her second round two months later was.</p><p>“When my love had his accident, we all held onto hope that I’d be pregnant that month,” she wrote on Instagram when announcing her pregnancy. “We’d been trying for a baby. IVF was on our cards but it wasn’t something I ever imagined I’d be tackling on my own. Bittersweet like none other, I’ve never been more certain or excited about anything in my entire life.”</p><h3 class=component__title>Trending News</h3><a href=# class=content-author__name data-invalid-url-rewritten-http>Sophie Reardon</a> <a href=# data-invalid-url-rewritten-http><span class=img><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/10/29/54cd09c4-7d5b-4687-a12c-3b0c200cbf6b/thumbnail/80x80/e7646698d6d036011ac42559df414d7b/sophie-reardon.jpg# alt="sophie-reardon.jpg " height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></a><p class=content-author__text>Sophie Reardon is a News Editor at CBS News.
