Rapper<strong> Future</strong> sounded off on Twitter this week over a controversial move made by his ex-fiancée, <strong>Ciara</strong>.</p><p>The “Body Party” singer, 29, <a href=#>made headlines</a> on Friday, July 31, when she first toted baby <strong>Future</strong>, the 14-month-old son whom she shares with her ex, to visit her new boyfriend, Seattle Seahawks player <strong>Russell Wilson</strong>. Ciara brought her cute kid with her to the Seahawks’ training camp in Seattle, where Wilson is practicing with his team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In shots from the season prep, which continued this week, baby Future is shown hugging Wilson, 26, and taking in the action from the sidelines in his mother’s arms. The visit was a polarizing one as some fans applauded the sweet moment while others slammed it as “inappropriate” and too soon in the relationship between the singer and the athlete.</p><p>While rapper Future, 31, chose not to name his ex directly, he tweeted after the pictures surfaced of his son with Ciara’s new man.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Never make a permanent decision over a temporary circumstance #umtoobossedup,” <a href=#>he wrote</a>&nbsp;on Saturday, Aug. 1. “Don’t direct my tweets to kno punk ass hoe… The devil gone come Frm all angles but I’m cover wit Angels…”</p><p>Ciara, who has been dating Wilson since April,&nbsp;seemed to take little notice of her former flame, <a href=#>taking to Instagram</a> on Monday, Aug. 3, to share a gorgeous shot of herself posing with Wilson on the football field. The Grammy winner, who split from Future in August 2014 following the couple’s October 2013 engagement, went on to post a second photo, this time of herself and her baby at the camp.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Ciara and Russell Wilson</a></p><p>For his part, Wilson seems to be ignoring the drama and focusing on his football game and his faith. The quarterback, who quickly became the Seahawks’ star player, spent recent days <a href=#>tweeting Bible verses</a> and sending love to his teammates.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilson’s faith has come to the forefront as of late, as he and Ciara have publicized their decision to remain abstinent in their relationship. Ciara, who hinted at rumored infidelity on Future’s part in her song “I Bet,” said she and her love are waiting for marriage before they have sex, <a href=#>or as she put it</a>, abstaining “until the deal is sealed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ2urKWnsm7CxKerrGWRm8GmvoycoJqqkWKvs7XNoKpmmpGXxm7Azmaprqujmrmtedaio6ynnqh6sb7AnKuim5Vif3F9lG1v</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
