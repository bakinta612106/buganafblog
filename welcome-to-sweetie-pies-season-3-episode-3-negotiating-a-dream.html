From choosing a new direction in his professional life, to family drama at Sweetie Pie’s and even a pregnancy scare, he’s finally learning how hard it can be to come of age. Watch as Lil’ Charles does some soul searching.</p><p>OWN describes the show as follows:</p><p>“When Robbie Montgomery, a 1960’s backup singer and former “Ikette” of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, suffered a collapsed lung and had to stop singing, she decided to pour her talents into another creative venture — a soul food restaurant called Sweetie Pie’s. At her family-oriented eatery, which she runs with her son, Tim, both hilarity and drama are offered in equal measure. It turns out, at the age of seventy, Miss Robbie’s life in the limelight is not over, as she finds herself still entertaining the masses every day at Sweetie Pie’s! You can always find her on the floor of the restaurant, during the busy lunch rush, cutting up and chatting with the slew of customers who come from all over the world to get a taste of her famous soul food. Her headstrong son, Tim, is her business partner, and together they have two Sweetie Pie’s locations running successfully. For Miss Robbie, however, that is not enough, and now she is working to build her legacy and plans to open a new, even bigger Sweetie Pie’s in downtown St. Louis, where as a little girl, she was not allowed during segregation. She’s come a long way, and this willful woman doesn’t plan on letting anything stand in the way of her dreams to own a building with a huge restaurant and banquet facility.”</p><p>“Welcome to Sweetie Pie’s” season 3, episode 3 airs Mar. 29 at 9 p.m. <span class=GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark id=fa6296dd-ba94-4feb-afef-b8d8d628bc38>on</span> OWN.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX51e49sZmtxX6yyra%2FOppxmrJ9iwLixxK2gnmWgnrK0edKemKynnmKAbrHPoqqonJVigG66xKCmraGRqbavs4yaZJ2qlZa6cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
