James Corden and his wife Julia Carey are expecting their third child.</p><p>As first reported by <a href=#>People</a>, the baby is due in December. The happy couple, who have been married since 2012, already have two children, six-year-old son Max and two-year-old daughter Carey.</p><p>Speaking about <a href=#>being a father</a> when Julia was expecting Carey, James said:&nbsp;“I don’t think there is a person that doesn’t have a feeling of ‘I really don’t know if I can do this’.</p><p>“What I have enjoyed is, when you’re having your first child you think you are having a baby. You’re not. You are having a fully-fledged person who is going to have opinions and thoughts and stories. Who’ll make you laugh and make you cross and become the absolute centre of your world and you become the centre of theirs.</p><p>“Second time around I feel that a lot more, like ‘Oh man, I really can’t wait to know who you are and what choices you are going to make’.”</p><p>Over the years, James Corden has gone from strength to strength. The British actor, comedian, and TV presenter’s career spans over 20 years, although he first rose to prominence in&nbsp;Fat Friends during 2000-2005. In 2007, he was truly put on the map thanks to Gavin and Stacey,&nbsp;which he co-wrote and starred in alongside Ruth Jones, in addition to Mathew Horne and Joanna Page. James also starred in One Man, Two Guvnors in the National Theatre, West End and on Broadway, with his performance in the latter winning him a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.</p><p>In March 2015, he presented his very first The Late Late Show which catapulted him to super stardom on both sides of the pond. His Carpool Karaoke segment is a viral sensation and has drawn in the likes of <a href=#>Adele</a>, <a href=#>Sia</a>, <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a>, <a href=#>One Direction</a>, <a href=#>Take That</a>, and many more.</p><h4>Congratulations to James Corden and Julia Carey on their wonderful news!
