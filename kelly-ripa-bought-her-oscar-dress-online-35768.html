Because the talk show host bought her peach-colored Roland Mouret gown online!</p><p>Ripa explains, “When you do these award shows, designers will loan you dresses and you try them on, and it’s like very dramatic all the time.”</p><p>The 43-year-old adds, “It’s just fraught with all kinds of, ‘This needs to be tailored,’ ‘We can’t tailor this because we don’t own it…blah blah blah.'”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Oscars 2014: Cate Blanchett’s Oscar Look & How It Compares To Her Last 5 Oscar Dresses!</strong></a></p><p>So she took matters into her own hands! “I was on what I call ‘the mall,’ which is Net-a-Porter.com online, and I was flipping through, just looking at what’s new, and I see this gown,” the 5-foot-3 star says of her dress.</p><p>“And I click on it, and it’s Roland Mouret, which is a designer I wear all the time. And I was like, ‘Can I really order an Academy Awards dress online? I mean, is that crazy?'”</p><p>But Ripa shares that she couldn’t be happier she chose to buy a dress this year rather than borrow one!</p><p>“I purchased it. So it’s mine. So I can alter it,” explains the Live with Kelly and Michael host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kelly-ripa-oscars-back.jpg><p>“It was the most comfortable—everybody else you see they’re corseted and they’re freaking out. Can they eat? Can they swallow? My dress: zipped it in, put it on, walked it out there.”</p><p>The star even indulged in some snacks during the show. “We had pizza backstage. I was like, ‘Look at me! Look at me go, like a real person walking the red carpet.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8qeo6WxXae2sa2Mm6aun5ipeqmx0WamrJuRp3qlvsSsqmannqG2r7GMbGxwbmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
