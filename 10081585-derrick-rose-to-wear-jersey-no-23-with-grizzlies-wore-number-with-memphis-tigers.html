He averaged 14.9 points, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds in 40 games and led the Tigers to a 38-2 overall record. They made the National Championship, losing out to Kansas 75-68 in overtime for the title.</p><p>He earned Third-Team All-American honors and would be a finalist for the Bob Cousy and John Wooden Awards. He would go on to be the No. 1 pick of his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA Draft.</p><p>Rose wore No. 25 in high school, but switched to No. 23 with the Tigers because the school had retired No. 25 for Penny Hardaway. He would revert to No. 1 with the Bulls before finally getting No. 25 when he joined the New York Knicks in 2017. He would also add No. 4 to his jersey collection, but now finally wears his college number.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGaCeYGMnZyrqpmYuG6%2BzqycZqyfYsSmrdFmoZ6qo5rGbrrOZmlsZaeewal5xqugs7KcnrK0edaoqZ5lnqq6o7HRZq6irJhiuqa5z6GgrGWknrSmvtI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
