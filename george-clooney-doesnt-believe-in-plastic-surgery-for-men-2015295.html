During an interview with <a href=#>BBC’s Radio 4</a>, the Tomorrowland actor, 54, revealed he’s against men getting plastic surgery because it only makes them look older.</p><p>"Clearly, I haven't. For me, it isn't an issue or an option,” the hunk said when asked about dying his hair or contemplating going under the knife. “I don't think it would make much sense, quite honestly…I’ve seen it happen and…particularly on men, I don't think it really works well. I actually think it makes you look older."&nbsp;</p><p>While Clooney jokes that you only have two options in life — “get older or die” — <strong>Amal Alamuddin</strong>’s husband wants everyone to embrace aging.</p><p>"I'm a big believer in the idea that you can't try to look younger," he added. "You just have to try to look the best you can at the age you are and not worry about it."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Ocean’s Eleven alum does admit, however, that it is harder on women.&nbsp;</p><p>"I will say that there's nothing fun—and I know for actresses it's infinitely worse because of public perception based on nothing except studios not hiring them and those sorts of things—but I think for all of us, you have to come to terms with getting older and not trying to fight it," he concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6ep6Kcsm6vy6imp52pYrGwsdKnq2aalaG2psLEZqCnZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxYyfpqtlnZq7bn6PamxrcWU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
