At first, Ms. Lane gravitated towards Xandy looking for comfort when Leo Stark (Greg Rikaart) was to publish a scandalous article in the Spectator. Since then, these once enemies have turned into friends and are seemingly headed down a romantic path. With Kiriakis still harboring feelings for Sarah Horton (Linsey Godfrey), can Chloe help him finally move past his ex to start a new romantic chapter in his life?</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers – Xander Kiriakis & Chloe Lane Are Moving At A Nice Pace</h3><p>Days spoilers hint that <a href=#>Chloe and Xander will decide to move in together</a> the week of April 24th. While this seems like the two may be “rushing” things, it’s likely on a platonic level. Chloe and Xand are actually moving at a nice pace, enjoying meals and games of darts as they evolve from foes into friends.</p><p>Xander is still in love with Sarah, which was the main reason he cut ties with Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien). Meanwhile, Chloe’s feelings for Brady Black (Eric Martsolf) have been fading fast, all thanks to his over-meddling daughter Rachel Black (Finley Rose Slater). They probably won’t jump into bed or establish a romantic relationship anytime soon, but rather discover the interesting qualities each has as they explore a solid friendship.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Xander Kiriakis (Paul Telfer) and Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin)" width=800 height=531 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/04/days-of-our-lives-dool-spoilers-will-chloe-lane-finally-help-xander-kiriakis-forget-about-sarah-horton/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives (DOOL) Spoilers: Will Chloe Lane Finally Help Xander Kiriakis Forget About Sarah Horton?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DOOL-Chloe-and-Xander.png></p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Updates – Xander Kiriakis Has Truly Changed & Chloe Lane Will Reap The Benefits</h3><p><a href=#>Xandy went from zero to hero</a> when he was with Sarah. There was a major transformation in his character, and while he slipped back into schemer mode at times, he led with a genuine heart. Learning from his mistakes with Ms. Horton means that once Chloe and Xander realize that they should be more than just friends, Ms. Lane will enjoy the benefits of this new Xander.</p><p>He’s a very far cry from the man he was when her first entered Salem in 2015 but still encompasses that charm and bad boy feel (without all the “bad”). The only thing that could get in their way is a returning Sarah Horton, as fans know she left expecting Xandy’s child. Chloe and Mr. Kiriakis will likely fall in love over the summer months, and establish something solid, only for Mr. Horton and Baby Kiriakis to arrive back on the Salem scene. While Xandy will want to be a father to his child, will Sarah be a factor for him, or can Chloe help Kiriakis forget about her?</p><p>Will Chloe help Xander finally get over Sarah?
