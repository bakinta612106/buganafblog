All about how he came up with Flamin’ Hot.</h2><p><strong>Richard Montaez</strong> is a businessman and author who claims to be the inventor of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. Montaez was reared in a California migrant labor camp as one of ten siblings and did not come from a business family.&nbsp;He had to drop out of school and work as a laborer before getting employed as a janitor for Frito-Lay at its Rancho Cucamonga facility at the age of 18 in 1976.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Richard-Montanez-2.jpg alt="Richard Montañez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The origins of Richard Montaez’s Flamin’ Hot Cheetos are an intriguing tale. He claims to have had the idea for a chile-covered Cheeto while working as a janitor at Frito-Rancho Lay’s Cucamonga facility.&nbsp;When a Cheetos machine malfunctioned, Montaez took a batch of unflavored Cheetos home and seasoned them with Mexican seasonings. He took a leap of faith after being impressed with the findings, offering the concept to then-CEO Roger Enrico over the phone.&nbsp;Montaez was requested to do an in-person presentation, during which he positioned the product as attractive to the rising Latino market and distributed samples in hand-decorated and sealed plastic bags.</p><p>Six months later, the substance was tested in Los Angeles before being authorized for nationwide distribution in 1992. According to reports, the taste revitalized the brand and generated billions of dollars in income.&nbsp;Richard Montaez, driven by a desire to achieve, out-hustled all corporate backstabbers who sought to bring him down for going out of line, and ascended up the ranks to renown.</p><p><strong>Richard Montañez</strong> was later appointed PepsiCo’s vice president of multicultural sales and community marketing, and he is currently a motivational speaker and leadership teacher. A Boy, a Burrito, and a Cookie, based on his life experiences, and Flamin’ Hot: The Incredible True Story of One Man’s Rise from Janitor to Top Executive, based on his life experiences.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Richard-Montanez-1.jpeg alt="Richard Montañez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More information about Eva Longoria’s next film based on business CEO AP Entertainment.</h2><p>Montaez’s story of a Mexican-American underdog whose brilliance won the corporate world is a well-known rags-to-riches story. It has now been made into a film directed by Eva Longoria and produced for Searchlight Pictures by super-producer DeVon Franklin. Longoria allegedly said in an interview:</p><p>“I’ve got Flamin’ Hot coming out, which is the other feature picture I made while COVID.” A movie about Richard Montaez, the guy who invented the Flamin’ Hot Cheeto, is great.
