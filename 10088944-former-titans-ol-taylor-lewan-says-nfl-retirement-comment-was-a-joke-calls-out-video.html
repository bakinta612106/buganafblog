I told them yes as long as they keep me saying it's a joke in the clip&lt;br>&lt;br>Obviously they didn't listen and got what they wanted. Congrats on getting numbers I guess. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kr2DRwXWdW">https://t.co/kr2DRwXWdW&lt;/a></p><p>Lewan battled injuries over two of the last three seasons. The 32-year-old suffered a torn ACL in 2020 that limited him to five games, and another knee problem ended his 2022 campaign after just two games.</p><p>In May, Lewan <a href=# rel=noopener>sued Dr. James Andrews</a> for medical malpractice and alleged the surgery for the 2020 ACL tear resulted in "permanent injury to his right knee, and surrounding structures, tendons, cartilage, and ligaments."</p><p>Based on the lawsuit, it seemed fair to conclude Lewan was hanging up his cleats. Along with the injury, he said in the litigation he's suffering from "severe pain and disability, suffering, disfigurement, loss of ability to enjoy life."</p><p>Lewan was also honest about the uncertainty surrounding his future when speaking to <a href=# rel=noopener>Jim Wyatt</a> of the Titans' official site in February. He said he was expecting to get cut by the team and that he'd "have to weigh the pros and cons of playing football, or not playing football."</p><p>As the offseason wore on without Lewan getting another contract, he looked for all intents and purposes done as an NFL player.</p>Paul Kuharsky <span class=acct>@PaulKuharskyNFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I expect Taylor Lewan to make his retirement official in the next month. Unsurprising based on what he looks like weight-wise right now.
