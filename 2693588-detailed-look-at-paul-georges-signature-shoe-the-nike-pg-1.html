Since LeBron James was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">awarded</a> his original deal in 2003, the list of signature athletes has remained sparse.</p><p>Rolling the years back to James in '03, Nike has only signed signature contracts with Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. George continues Nike basketball's distinct heritage with his PG 1 model, slated to make its official debut February 25.<br></p><p>Important hoop-related kicks&nbsp;are always about distinct levels of technology and a sense of playability. Looking at what the PG 1 has to offer from a tech vantage point is a good starting point for Bleacher Report's Kicks detailed looked at the shoe.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/513/a5c27eca98be6c06b5c218714574b999_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/513/a5c27eca98be6c06b5c218714574b999_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Image courtesy of Nike</span><p><strong>PG 1 Technology</strong><br></p><p>The term Flywire can be described as Nike's personalized cable system. Mirco-sized filaments are woven together and processed with a light fabric overlay to remove any excessive weight from a sneaker's upper—the difference between Flywire and leather is like slogging around under water versus floating on the moon.<br></p><p>It's become part of Nike's platform to build Flywire into almost any athletic product when feasible. George's first signature model was given this treatment.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/519/ab3f9c3fd77b9ee69eddb1880e543f96_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/519/ab3f9c3fd77b9ee69eddb1880e543f96_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Image courtesy of Nike</span><p>Understanding that a great basketball sneaker directly correlates to the cushioning system at hand is vital. For the PG 1, Nike went with the traditional—yet always effective—Zoom Air unit.</p><p>To delve a little deeper into what the Zoom Air unit actually is, you have to understand, like Flywire, the Zoom Air unit begins with tightly-wound cable structure. These cables are secured into place, and, as an athlete moves around, they balloon and restrict to provide pressurized stability and comfort.</p><p>Designer Tony Hardman was tasked with creating George's sneaker. He used the coveted Nike Zoom Crusader—another sneaker Hardman assembled—as the base for the PG 1's fit.<br></p><p>When you break down the shoe's traction, Hardman created a specialized pattern, etched onto the sole, that reflects fish scales. That's not only good for staying low to the floor, but it also serves as a tribute to George's love for fishing—a hobby grew up with thanks to his father, Paul George Sr.<br></p><p>All of these elements, pieced together by a tightening forefoot strap, give the PG 1 a true Nike signature athlete look and feel.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/517/dfe2688342dafc22b8a990b02d9f00ad_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/517/dfe2688342dafc22b8a990b02d9f00ad_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Image courtesy of Nike</span><p><strong>PG 1 Aesthetics</strong><br></p><p>When visuals are at play, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The PG 1 looks like a Nike basketball shoe. There's no doubt about that.<br></p><p>The low-top, sock-liner, commanding forefoot strap and mesh-like toe box are all elements passed down from various Nike products onto the PG 1. It's a top-heavy product in terms of basketball design.</p><p>Colorways will be key to the growth of the PG 1—like any good Nike model. Be on the lookout for what the Swoosh Empire creates for George on that front as the 2016-17 season moves forward.<br></p><p>Every Nike signature athlete has also been paired with a logo. It's sort of a right of passage. George is no different. The PG 1 features a geometric triangle design, naturally combining the letters P and G.<br></p><p>You might not notice it at first, however, that triangular logo actually is a bowtie. A tribute to George's sophisticated style.<br></p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/514/65441d46be360f0b5a9f88af730caa65_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/514/65441d46be360f0b5a9f88af730caa65_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Image courtesy of Nike</span><p>This logo has been placed on the tongue of the sneaker, not to mention the sole, where it's been stuck between the toe and heel platforms.</p><p>Like every Nike signature shoe, there are a handful of Easter eggs present. On the sides of the sneaker, the dates "5-1-15" and "5-2-90" were added, honoring his daughter's first birthday and George's arrival on Earth.<br></p><p>One of the coolest features comes by way of the heel tab. A rod-like graphic was added in to remind George about that devastating leg injury he suffered in 2014.<br></p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/575/998b0553bebd51918d6e47168daa2e76_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/639/575/998b0553bebd51918d6e47168daa2e76_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Image courtesy of Nike</span><p><strong>PG 1 Conclusion</strong></p><p>You're going to get enough tech features to enjoy playing in these kicks. As the rest of the aesthetics-driven portion of the conversation goes, that's a dialogue best served between consumer and sneaker.<br></p><p>George's line likely won't achieve success like what Durant and James have done for the company. However, can PG's kicks rival sales numbers of Irving and Bryant now that he's gone?</p><p>"I expect the shoe will sell well in a limited amount,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">" Matt Powell</a> of the&nbsp; Group explained.<br></p><p>The initial "Shining" version is set for a February 25 release for $110, featuring a cross between jet black and silver detailing.
