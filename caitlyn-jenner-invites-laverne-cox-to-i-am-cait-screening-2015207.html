The reality star hosted a private, advanced screening of her TV show I Am Cate on Sunday, July 19, and top of the invite list was fellow transgender celebrity <strong>Laverne Cox</strong>.</p><p>Cox has been very outspoken about her respect for Jenner and her appreciation of for the great things Jenner's journey has done for the transgender community in general. And judging by the photos Cox shared <a href=#>via Instagram</a> of the fun, private get together, the love and respect is flowing both ways!</p><p>"@caitlynjenner and I finally met in person at a special private advance screening of #IAmCait," Cox captioned a photo of herself and Jenner posing together at the event. "#TransIsBeautiful #girlslikeus #caitlynjenner," she added.</p><p>Cox looked very glamorous in a black crop top and matching black mini skirt with gold patterning. Jenner, who had a pretty blowout, looked more casual in a pair of skinny blue jeans and a flowing white shirt.</p><p>Also in attendance at Jenner's preview bash was the former Olympian's mentor <strong>Candis Cayne </strong>(who matched Jenner in a flowing white shirt).</p><p>"Fun with #girlslikeus tonight at the screening of #IAmCait," Cox captioned another picture of Jenner with all seven of her guests.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last month, Cox took to <a href=#>Tumblr</a> to express her feelings about Jenner’s courageous coming out photos in <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. “Yes, Caitlyn looks amazing and is beautiful but what I think is most beautiful about her is her heart and soul," Cox said. "The ways she has allowed the world into her vulnerabilities. The love and devotion she has for her family and that they have for her. Her courage to move past denial into her truth so publicly. These things are beyond beautiful to me," she added.</p><p>Jenner was quick to respond: "You are fierce and fabulous!" the parent of six wrote via Twitter. "Your support means the world. Thank you for all that you do for the community."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqaoaShxq95yZ6lp52iYravwsitnKxlnJbDpr7NnmScp6hiwbB5yGaYpmWTlra1edKcqZ6dnp67qHmRaWhuamBs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
