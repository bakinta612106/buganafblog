Kardashian, 39, who just began her new lifestyle website called Poosh, sat down for an interview with her mom where they discussed how women can “be a boss.”</p><p>It was during this conversation where the 39-year-old mother-of-three revealed who she worked with when she was first starting out in the beauty game. “I don’t think people realize,” the Kardashian sister began, “that I used to be your assistant and that I learned so much from you about being a boss.”</p><p>The reality star explained that one of the main lessons she learned from her mother was to never “take no for an answer.” Kourtney admitted she has a tough time accepting the answer “no,” and has actively worked at getting the answer, “yes.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvuOLdWHzvz/</p><p>However, it wasn’t a one-way relationship. Kris, 63, also learned a lot from her oldest daughter. “You were such a great little student,” Kris remarked, stating that it was a “such a great experience” for her as well. Kris went on to say that she learned a lot about “closing deals and getting your way.”</p><p>Another key thing Kourtney learned was how to get a non-paying client to return the money they owe. Jenner added that one of the life mottos which have served her well over the years is to never take the answer no, moreover, if she’s talking to such a person, it’s probably the wrong person anyway.</p><p>Just before the season 16 premiere of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday, Kris spoke to Ryan Seacrest on his show on Friday to explain how proud she was of her kids and how they’re all making the right decisions in life.</p><p>“And I really trust all of my kids to make those good decisions,” Kris explained, in reference to her children, Kylie, Kendall, Rob, Khloe, Kim, and Kourtney. The Kardashian-Jenner clan has only expanded in popularity and fame since the debut of their reality series over ten years ago.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Since then, the youngest member of the family, Kylie, began her makeup company, <a href=#>Kylie Cosmetics, which Forbes valued at approximately $800,000,000.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebpMKzwM2esGajkaexor%2FHopinZaKaw6aty6xkrKCVYsK0scNmq6hlkpp6rL7IrGSjnZ6jsrO%2FjKmcq6ufo66tecCsqqKrpJa7tXmRb2xpa2Bk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
