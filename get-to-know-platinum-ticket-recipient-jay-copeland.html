Jay, whose full name is Jeremiah Copeland, is a 23-year-old from Salisbury, Maryland. He graduated from&nbsp;Salisbury College with bachelor’s degrees in theater and music, and, before his audition, was in graduate school on a fellowship for a master’s degree in acting. However, Jay said that he was given an ultimatum to choose between music and acting. Therefore, he dropped out of graduate school <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and chose </a><a href=#>American Idol</a>.</p><p>Jay wowed the judges, Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan, with his joyous rendition of “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” by Stevie Wonder. When the song ended, all three judges gave him a standing ovation. Katy declared that the show needed Jay.&nbsp;Lionel said, “We’ve been waiting for you to walk through that door. I’m so happy you showed up.”&nbsp;Luke agreed, saying that Jay would be able to “electrify” a crowd and that he was “perfect” in his opinion. Katy added, “Finally, a competition.”</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>American Idol: Get To Know First Platinum Ticket Recipient HunterGirl</a></span></p><p>The judges then awarded Jay with the platinum ticket, as Katy called him a superstar.&nbsp;Only three platinum tickets were given out this season, one for each audition city.

Get to know more about Jay as <a href=#>he begins his&nbsp;American Idol&nbsp;journey</a>.</p><h2>Music Runs in Jay’s Family</h2><p>Jay comes from a long line of successful singers, including his grandfather, George Copeland, his mother, Christina Ryder, and her brother and Jay’s uncle, Josh Copeland. George is the bishop of United Faith Church of Deliverance in Salisbury and once had a singing group called Reverend Copeland and the Singing Disciples.&nbsp;Jay’s mother and his uncles, including Josh who was about 7 at the time, also had a singing group called The Singing Copelands, which Josh said was like the gospel version of the Jackson 5.</p><p>Josh, who was also a finalist on the BET singing reality show&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;Best in 2019, said that every time that Jay has been on stage, he has received a standing ovation. He said,&nbsp;“And not only that, but you will see certain people weeping because of the specialness inside of him.”&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delmarva Now</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>the first people who Jay told</a> about his audition for the celebrity judges were his mother and stepdad. His mother recalled,&nbsp;“I was so excited for him because this has always been a dream of his.”</p><h2>Hometown Love</h2><p>Jay loves his hometown of Salisbury, Maryland, and its residents adore him in return. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delmarva Now</a>, Jay shared that he misses his loved ones back home and the atmosphere of Salisbury. He said,&nbsp;“I am a small town boy at heart.”&nbsp;In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">47ABC</a>, Jay shared that coming from Salisbury has taught him that “opportunities and blessings can come from anywhere no matter how big or small.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>American Idol: Get To Know Kenedi Anderson, Platinum Ticket Recipient</a></span></p><h2>Jay Thought His Callback Was A Scam</h2><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f48eYop3LYU</a></p><p>In an email statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delmarva Now/The Daily Times</a>, Jay admitted that he was skeptical when he first found out that he would have the chance to audition for <a href=#>the producers of&nbsp;American Idol</a>. He thought it was “a joke and a scam.” However, he realized through some research that it was actually legitimate and he “gave it a shot. I doubted myself and did not believe I would make it past one producer. Little did I know that I would make it to the celebrity judge auditions.”</p><h2>What Music Means To Jay</h2><p>Jay explained why music means so much to him, writing,&nbsp;“Music is important to me because it allows me to see myself in ways I never thought I could. I love making people happy and seeing them smile. I believe music can do just that and more.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jay acknowledged that making it in the music business can be difficult, but he has a strong faith. <a href=#>Jay shared with 47ABC</a>, “If you do get discouraged, I know where my help comes from. I look to the Lord. So whatever you believe in – if it’s friends, God, if it’s your parents – go to them because it can be rough in this field.”</p><h2>Jay’s Social Media</h2><p>Fans of Jay can find him on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.
