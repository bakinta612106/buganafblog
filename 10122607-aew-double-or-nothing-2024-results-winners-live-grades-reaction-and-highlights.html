AEW showed the various pairs in a four-way split screen at different times so we could follow all of the mayhem. The crowd was singing and cheering the whole time.</p><p>After the song stopped, the crowd chanted "We want music." It was hard to follow the action at times until everyone made their way back to the ringside area, but that never stopped it from being entertaining.</p><p>Trying to summarize everything we saw would be impossible, but at one point, Perry appeared to run over Allin with a truck outside the arena. That's how crazy AEW tried to make this.</p><p>As Perry was coming back, he grabbed Tony Khan and tried to drag him to the ring. Allin showed up with a flame thrower and lit the former Jungle Boy on fire. He was quickly extinguished but it was still a wild moment to witness.</p><p>Allin was tied to a cable from the rafters, Harwood was hit with an exploding chair, and the Bucks used shoes covered in tacks to kick Allin in the face as he was hung up like a pinata.</p><p>Much like the TNT title bout, your level of enjoyment is going to depend on how much you like chaos and non-traditional violence in your pro wrestling. This was certainly a spectacle. Nobody can deny that.</p><p>After he returned from being set ablaze, Perry hit Danielson with a running knee for the pin and the win.</p><p><b>Result: </b>The Elite defeated Team AEW</p><p><b>Notable Moments and Observations</b></p><ul class="atom bulletedList"><li>When Justin Roberts made the introductions, he said "Welcome to the s--t show."</li><li>The shameless Reebok plug was kind of funny.&nbsp;</li><li>Allin had a mask on because his nose was still broken from being hit by a bus.&nbsp;</li><li>Harwood looked like he was busted open by a beer can thrown by a dumb fan who was hopefully kicked out.&nbsp;</li><li>It was kind of weird seeing Harwood and Wheeler in long tights instead of their usual trunks.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bucks put Allin on their entrance elevator and had him lowered down to trap him.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeDcYOMmpywZZSkwqO4xGamq2WepMGptc2gZGtoYml6s7HSrqOtq12stq%2B6xKuqZqSZq7Jus9Gam56rXaeyoq%2FToqanZZGjsW60yKCfpaGXncG0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
