Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is very eager to learn about who ratted them out, and there’s a good chance he’ll get to the bottom of things. But what happens next if and when he does?</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers – Sonny Corinthos Isn’t The Same Sonny Corinthos</h3><p>GH spoilers tease that<a href=# rel=nofollow> Sonny isn’t the same old Sonny</a> he used to be. After all, fans can attest to how much he’s changed and mellowed out since he had amnesia and fell in love with Nina in Nixon Falls. Sonny has a soft spot for Reeves, and despite the “mistakes” she’s made in the past, he’s always willing to erase them so that the two can move forward.</p><p>If Sonny figures out Nina was behind the SEC tip, he’ll be upset. But will it be a deal-breaker in their relationship? Especially considering all the bad blood between her and Carly, and what Ms. Spencer has done to Reeves?</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard)" width=800 height=491 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/05/general-hospital-gh-spoilers-sonny-finds-out-nina-was-behind-tipping-sec-keeps-her-secret/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital (GH) Spoilers: Sonny Finds Out Nina Was Behind Tipping SEC, Keeps Her Secret" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GH-Sonny-Corinthos-2.png></p><h3>General Hospital Updates – Sonny Corinthos Makes A Promise To Keep The Information Hidden</h3><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Nina found out about the insider trading</a> information from overhearing a conversation. It’s not like the mob boss confided in her and she blabbed. In addition, he held that “secret” from her, and she wasn’t upset at him; she didn’t retaliate against Corinthos or even make it an issue in their romance. At the end of the day, Sonny will be mad and frustrated at Nina for what she did, but he won’t necessarily break up with her. He may even try and help hide the fact that Reeves was behind it all as it would cause more drama than good at this point.</p><p>What will Sonny do if he learns Nina was the one who tipped the authorities about Carly and Drew? Will he break up with her or just “hash it out” and return to normal? Chime in on this storyline in the comments section. <a href=#>Watch General Hospital on ABC daily to see how this all unfolds and visit this often for all the latest GH news and spoilers.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49uZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq15xqFkrKifnrmmvtJmqqimnq56p7XNnapmp6Wpeq%2B1zZpksJmjYq%2BmtMinm2asmaW9qrrGZqqem12gsqa80mafnqpdqLKkvsStZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
