Eric Matthews, the inventor of the Feeny Call, and Mr. Feeny, the greeting's namesake, are reuniting in a big way.</p><p><strong>Will Friedle</strong> (Eric) and <strong>William Daniels</strong> (Feeny) are appearing in upcoming episodes of Girl Meets World, the writers for the Boy Meets World spin-off announced on Wednesday, Dec. 3.&nbsp;</p><p>Referencing the Boy Meets World season seven episode "Seven the Hard Way," in which an alternate future is shown and Eric Matthews is depicted as a reclusive hermit who has renamed himself "Plays With Squirrels," an upcoming episode is called "Girl Meets Mr. Squirrels." The girl in question is the starring character named Riley Matthews (<strong>Rowan Blanchard</strong>), the daughter of now-adult parents Cory Matthews (<strong>Ben Savage</strong>) and Topanga Matthews (<strong>Danielle Fishel</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>Riley will finally meet her Uncle Eric, after Girl Meets World previously featured cameos by original favorites Stuart Minkus (<strong>Lee Norris</strong>) and Harley Keiner (<strong>Danny McNulty</strong>), and publicized the return of Shawn Hunter (<strong>Rider Strong</strong>), who will appear in "Girl Meets Home for the Holidays," set to air on Friday, Dec. 5. After making a brief cameo in the June pilot, Mr. Feeny will make his grand return to the show in the second season as well.</p><p>"Shawn, Eric and Mr. Feeny will be an important part of season 2," <a href=#>the Girl Meets World writers tweeted</a>. "Lives will change. People will grow. People won't… We just completed two shows with William Daniels. The cast went to Mr. Feeny's house to retrieve something from the past."</p><p>Both Daniels, 87, and Friedle, 38, have kept busy in the years since Boy Meets World's 2000 wrap. The former has been appearing in shows like Grey's Anatomy, Boston Legal, and The Closer, while the latter has done copious voice acting with gigs on Kim Possible, The Secret Saturdays, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Mad.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Friedle tweeted his excitement about reuniting with his former costars on Wednesday, <a href=#>writing</a>, "There is nothing as important as family. I think it is time I met my [niece]… I can tell you that 'they' are wrong… you CAN go home again… What a great day. To my old friends and my new ones…Thank you to the entire cast of #GirlMeetsWorld #youmakemelookgood."</p><p>The writers weighed in on just how good Friedle looked at the table reading, adding, "The table reading is over. In case you didn't know, Will Friedle is absolutely hysterical. Welcome home, Eric."</p><p>The Boy Meets World nostalgia will continue going forward, as the writers cryptically tweeted about another addition to the cast. "Another member of the original cast will also join us this year," the wrote. "There will be an announcement about it. That is all."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnqmim12irrXAx56urGWdp3qnscSnsGain567qrrGZpqoqqlirq%2BwjK2mqZmenK5uu81mnqKqnGK6prHTrGSwp6KhsW5%2Bj2prbWli</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
