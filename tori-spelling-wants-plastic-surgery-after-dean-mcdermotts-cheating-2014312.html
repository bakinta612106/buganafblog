As fans saw on the Nov. 25 episode of True Tori, the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum wants to go under the knife to fix her C-cup breast implants. But that's not all she wants.&nbsp;</p><p>A source reveals in the new issue of <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> that she's considering other cosmetic procedures, as well, in part because of a crisis of confidence following husband <strong>Dean McDermott</strong>'s December 2013 infidelity.</p><p>Spelling, 41, got her implants 15 years ago, when she was in her 20s. She's said before that she regrets them, but she didn't take action to fix them until her consultation with plastic surgeon Ashkan Ghavami on True Tori. "Me going to the doctor is a big step," she admitted on the Lifetime reality show.&nbsp;</p><p>So what inspired her to take that step? "She hit a rough patch with her self-esteem due to Dean's cheating," the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. "She doesn't feel good about herself and wants to do something."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second source counters that the mom of four is "confident" and wants the breast implant procedure for health concerns, some of which were highlighted by Dr. Ghavami during their consultation. "Your scar tissue is like, 'I don't want this thing, I want to squeeze this thing out,'" he told her. "I wouldn't be surprised if you had a little micro-rupture."</p><p>If she does have the surgery, other nip/tucks may follow. The Hollywood scion — who, in addition to her two breast augmentations, has admitted to a nose job — is also considering Botox fillers and a face-lift, the first insider says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmZ6ZpanGcLrEsKporJ%2Bntm6%2Fz56jpaGenHq4rc2tqmaonJbAtbXCZqquqpeav7p5wJ%2BrnqpdmbKiuoymmp2doqK8tcDSZpqhnZGptq%2BzjGtnamxjZn8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
