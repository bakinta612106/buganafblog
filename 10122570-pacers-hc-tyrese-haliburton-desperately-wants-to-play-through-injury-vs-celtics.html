Now Indiana, which is home for the next two games, faces an even greater challenge without its best player.</p><p>Haliburton's status for Game 4, which is scheduled for Monday evening, is also in "serious question," per ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrian Wojnarowski</a>.</p><p>Without Haliburton, the onus is on T.J. McConnell to step into the starting lineup. McConnell has been sensational this postseason, averaging 10.8 points and 5.1 assists in just 19.6 minutes per game. Pacers rookie Ben Sheppard should also see more playing time. Other candidates for more minutes include Doug McDermott and Jarace Walker.</p><p>Ultimately, losing Haliburton is tough for the Pacers against a 64-win Celtics team that's gone 10-2 in the playoffs thus far. But Indiana has also proven to be a resilient team that's overcome obstacles along the way to a great season.</p><p>We'll find out soon enough if the Pacers can pull off the big upset sans Haliburton when they host Boston on Saturday at 8:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmeCeHyMqZicnaKoeqmvjK2wq52jmnqprcuima6qpKS7brDErKeeqpGpsq3FjLCYp6yjYsGwec%2BlmLJlpJ2%2FsMHGoWSippqqv7p51axknJ2cqbakvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
