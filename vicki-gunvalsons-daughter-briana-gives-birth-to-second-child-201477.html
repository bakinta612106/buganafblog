Real Housewives of Orange County star <strong>Vicki Gunvalson </strong>revealed on Facebook on July 4 that her daughter <strong>Briana Wolfsmith-Culberson</strong> gave birth to her second child.</p><p>"Just got to LAX to catch a 6am flight to OKC. Our new baby decided to come a early," the reality star <a href=#>announced on her page</a>, "Can't get there quick enough! Pray for healthy baby and momma. 4thofJulybaby."</p><p>Gunvalson is already a proud grandmother to Briana and husband <strong>Ryan Culberson</strong>'s first child, 22-month-old son <strong>Troy</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>The self-described "Nana" was equally as excited when her daughter and son-in-law learned the sex of their second child. Back in January the Housewives veteran<a href=#> posted a picture</a> of the clan with blue balloons along with the caption: "So excited! Just found out baby #2 is a BOY! #troybigbrother #bestfriends #footballplayers." The adorable moment was also featured in an episode on this season of Real Housewives of Orange County.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Briana, who now lives in Oklahoma with Culberson, wrote in a blog post in 2013 that since having Troy, she's found a better appreciation for her mom, whom she openly has fought with on the Bravo series.&nbsp;</p><p>"Having Troy has allowed me to feel more empathetic for my mom and how amazing she is as a mother," the nurse wrote. "Throughout my life she has always put my brother and myself first and was always focused on our happiness. If I'm half as good of a mom as she is, then I'll have done something right."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaK2im5ueeqjBza%2BYpaufo8BusMCunqGslad6o77ImqWaZZeew6a%2FjJugq6yYYsGwedKemqimlGKwqbXLnWRraGFphHg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
