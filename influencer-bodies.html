"I'm taking a break from [social media] to get myself out of the matrix of it all, so I can Ô¨Ågure out how I want to use it. It's hard to come up with a unique approach to posting when you're on it all the time and you're seeing what other people are doing because you end up subconsciously copying what everyone else is doing. Whereas if you're taking a break and you're stepping back for a while, you can start thinking outside of the box. I've come to a point where I don't want to do anything that doesn't have a strong intention behind it."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-859993442.jpg><p>Sommer Ray, the fitness influencer and social media sensation, says to prioritize proper nutrition and fuel your body with wholesome foods.

After a quick lesson, I took a 2-hour tour that got me speeding through the forest and powder pastures up to 50 MPH."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1440427692.jpg><p><span>Model, TV presenter, and influencer, Alexa Chung, broke down the secrets to her amazing skin in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Savoir Flair</span></a><span>. "Once I'm out of the shower, I apply my body moisturizer, which is the La Roche-Posay 48-hour hydration one. Sometimes I add an oil, either Bio-Oil or Aesop's seed one. Face-wise, it should already be clean from the shower. I do my proper cleanse at night rather than in the morning, so ideally that doesn't have to happen.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1477965847.jpg><p><span>Baking YouTuber and influencer, Rosanna Pansino, shared her diet secrets </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>in this Facebook post</span></a><span>. "I often get asked how I can live a healthy lifestyle, while also having a sweet tooth. I have never been the best at sticking to a strict diet or a daily, high-intensity workout schedule. What I've found works best for me is enjoying the foods I love in moderation while keeping the majority of my meals on the healthier side."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1407153428.jpg><p><span>Chiara Ferragni does a lot of outdoor workouts to stay in shape.

It's one of the best ways to reduce your risk of health problems such as stroke, heart attack, some cancers, depression, diabetes, obesity and arthritis. If you don't have time to work out, commute and get your work out in."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1404095914.jpg><p><span>Reality TV star and influencer, Joey Essex, talked about his diet and exercise routine in an interview with the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>DailyMail</span></a><span>. "</span><span>I eat enough veg, especially broccoli and asparagus, but not as much fruit as I should, apart from a banana with my porridge every morning. Apple gets stuck in my teeth so I prefer blueberries and raspberries. I eat chicken or fish most days, and red meat about once a week. Although I'm not a very good cook I prefer eating freshly cooked meals than ready-made ones. I've never dieted ‚Äì I'm about 11 st and just under 6ft."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-654169892.jpg><p><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> star and influencer, Alex Bowen, likes to workout with his wife Olivia.

"</span><span>When I work out, I feel a lot better about myself and the release of endorphins gives me a happy energy that's incomparable. I work out when I can but mainly three times a week. That gives me an extra boost of confidence, not only in my body but also my head space."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1397807602.jpg><p><span>YouTuber and media personality, Joe Sugg, broke down his wellness secrets with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>GQ</span></a><span>. "</span><span>I recently got back into running. I've been clocking 5K runs at around 21-24 minutes at the moment, which is great for me. I would love to get my time down to under 20 minutes, but that's going to take a lot of work."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/GettyImages-1173729145.jpg><p><span>Ryan Libbey shared some of his fitness secrets with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>heatworld</span></a><span>.

One thing he likes to do is rock climb. Unglert talked about this </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>in this blog post</span></a><span>. "</span><span>I don't talk much about my rock climbing endeavors and there's a reason for it. Simply put, I'm not that good and it's something that still terrifies me but I love doing it anyway. My friends are usually the ones putting up routes and I'll follow up behind them cleaning their gear. The more I do it, the more fun it becomes and, in 2019, I made some fulfilling strides in the sport."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKq6xaWsnqaTmr9urs6doJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
