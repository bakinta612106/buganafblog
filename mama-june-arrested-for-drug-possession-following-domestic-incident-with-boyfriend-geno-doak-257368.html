Police took the reality tv star into custody after a domestic incident with her boyfriend, Geno Doak.</p><p>TMZ was first to break the news that the star has landed in jail. The celebrity website is reporting there was an altercation between Mama June and Doak at a local Alabama gas station. Police were called to the gas station after two people were spotted in a heated confrontation.</p><p>When the authorities arrived, they witnessed enough to take Doak into custody for domestic violence/harassment, felony possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. Cops also had enough evidence to book Mama June on charges of felony possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We're beyond excited for the return of Mama June: From Not to Hot! Stay tuned for the premiere TONIGHT at 9/8c on WE tv! <a href=# rel=nofollow>#mamajune</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/fSKnvWPyNu</a></p><p>— Life & Style (@Life_and_Style) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 15, 2019</a></p><p>The nature of the domestic dispute has not been revealed yet. Honey Boo Boo’s mom has not commented on the arrest and her rep has not released a statement either. News of both arrests comes hours before the new season of her WE tv show From Not To Hot.</p><p>Mama June must be out on bail because she used Twitter to let her fans know she would still be live Tweeting during the show. No doubt the topic of her recent time in jail will be what fans are looking to discuss not her TV show.</p><p>Doak is no stranger to being in trouble with the law. He has served jail time in the past for charges related to crimes that include burglary, theft and criminal damage to property. If he is found guilty on the new charges, he could be headed back to jail again. As for Mama June, her chances for prison depend on how severe the charge is, as well as if she turns on her boyfriend.</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/7egWl1wFMu</a></p><p>— Chris Rogers (@ChrisRogers86) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 15, 2019</a></p><p>The latter is highly unlikely considering most of From Not To Hot has focused on the couple’s three-year relationship. Season 2 ended with Mama June telling Doak he needs to either propose or she is moving on. She used social media after the ending to express her love for him, as well as share how much she wants to marry him.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Mama June Shannon and her boyfriend Geno Doak are both in some serious trouble involving drugs and a domestic dispute. There is definitely going to be more to this story so stay tuned!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedlrqiecmupZ5lkae%2Fpr%2FTnptmnp%2BneqW%2B1KBkqaejqLK0v8iopWaen6G5sMPIp55mnJ%2BisrTAyJxkoqaTnrGmutNmrqKsmGKvsMXFq6CeppRitKa6zmabqJmbYn92g5Jvb2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
