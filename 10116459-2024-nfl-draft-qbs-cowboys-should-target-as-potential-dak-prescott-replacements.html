Like Prescott, though, McCarthy is entering the final year of his contract.</p><p>Assuming the Cowboys select an offensive lineman early in the draft, Nix could have strong pass protection once he's ready to lead the offense.</p><p>He would also play with CeeDee Lamb, who <a href=# rel=noopener>led the league</a> in yards after the catch last season, and speedy veteran wide receiver Brandin Cooks. So, he may not have to do a lot of heavy lifting with deep throws for explosive plays.</p><p>As of today, Dallas has the perimeter playmakers and appropriate system to help Nix succeed if he's the eventual replacement for Prescott.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWuBdoWMa2drbF2js615w6uYn6xdpq%2B0ecKorpunqah6tLTOrqOdZaSWv6ix02aYrGWgpMGmutOimKVllJa4brzRnqqcp6SperOxz6WYnJ2dmru1vw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
