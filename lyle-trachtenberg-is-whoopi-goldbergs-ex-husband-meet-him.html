The duo went ahead to tie the nuptial knot in 1994 but unfortunately, their union crashed a few months later. His bad experience did not deter Lyle from moving on with his life and so after a few years, he got married for the second time. He is currently enjoying marital bliss with his wife, Adrianna Belan, with whom he shares two children. The Trachtenberg family lives in Los Angeles, California, where they are raising their daughters.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Lyle Trachtenberg’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Lyle Trachtenberg</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 1st January 1956</li><li><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg’s Age:</strong> 67 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Capricorn</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg’s Husband (Wife):</strong> Whoopi Goldberg (ex-spouse) and Adrianna Belan (current spouse)</li><li><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg’s Children:</strong> Natasha and Gabriella Trachtenberg</li><li><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 6 inches</li><li><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 168 cm</li><li><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg’s Net Worth:</strong> $1 million</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the ex-husband of Whoopi Goldberg</li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> @thetrack54</li></ul><h2><strong>When Was Lyle Trachtenberg Born?</strong></h2><p>Going by what we can sieve from online sources, Lyle Trachtenberg was born on the 1st of January 1956. He is a native of Los Angeles, California, where he also spent a better part of his growing-up years. It goes without saying that he is American by nationality, however, his ethnic background is said to be White.</p><p>Because he has never been a mainstream celebrity, many aspects of Lyle’s early life and family background have remained under the shade to date. However, it is common knowledge that he grew up as a lone child but the identities of his parents have never been disclosed.</p><p>While Lyle’s mother worked in the education sector as a classroom teacher, teaching the English Language in a school within their locality, his dad was part of the entertainment world. Reports have it that his father was a theater actor and was instrumental in nudging his son into the acting world.</p><p>Lyle Trachtenberg once narrated how he would tag along to the theater to watch his dad perform and unconsciously, the desire to follow suit continued getting stronger with each performance. Thus, he began to prepare himself in anticipation of an entertainment career. Lyle also experimented with sports during his student days, including football.</p><p>He was still very young when his parent’s union hit the rocks and he ended up with his dad who took charge of his life until he became independent.</p><h3><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg is a University Graduate</strong></h3><p>Lyle Trachtenberg went all the way to the university. The Los Angeles native is an alum of the University of California. Though his discipline has never been disclosed, he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts upon his graduation in 1980.</p><p>Even though he never mentioned his course of study, several sources claim he studied a course that is connected with performing. With his university education done and dusted, Lyle became eligible to be admitted into the ranks of his alma mater’s notable alumni which boast the likes of the Youtube Chief Executive Officer, Susan Wojcicki, John Franco, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Jackie Robinson(athlete), and Taylor Wang among many others.</p><p>Nothing has been said about Trachtenberg’s early academic journey but reports show that he was actively involved in drama during his high school days, as he was a member of his school’s drama club.</p><h2><strong>Lyle Trachtenberg and Whoopi Goldberg Met In 1992</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/R-3-e1673810984824.jpg><p>There is a dearth of information about the dating period between Lyle Trachtenberg and actress Whoopi Goldberg, but going by the available tidbits, the two first crossed paths in 1992. By then, Lyle was still trying to establish himself as an actor while his love interest, Whoopi, had already become a household name in the movie industry.</p><p>There are some online accounts claiming that the two were on a movie set when they set eyes on each other for the first time, but the name of the production has never earned a mention.</p><p>Reports say the duo commenced dating within a short period of time and things got really serious in the long run.</p><h2><strong>How Long Was Lyle Whoopi Goldberg’s Husband?</strong></h2><p>After dating for a few number of months, Lyle and Whoopi decided to take their relationship to the next level. We do not know exactly when they got engaged, but their nuptials occurred on the 1st of October 1994, barely a couple of years after they met.</p><p>The couple started living together as man and wife afterward, but married life did not obviously agree with them. While the public was not intimated on how things went between the interracial couple, the news of their separation rent the air before the end of 1995. Their divorce was completed a while later and since it was not publicized, there is no telling whether it was an amicable process or not.</p><p>Though Lyle Trachtenberg’s union with the celebrity actress was sadly short-lived, it had a positive impact on the unionist’s life by making him popular. His name now rings a bell as Whoopi’s former husband.</p><h3><strong>Why Did Their Marriage Fail</strong></h3><p>After the couple’s divorce was declared final, fans and the general public couldn’t help but wonder at the reason behind their split. Besides, Whoopi seems to have a bad record of failed relationships, and soon, the question on everyone’s lips was “who has the problem, the movie star or her ex-spouses”.</p><p>Nobody seemed to have the right answers to these questions until January 2017 when Lyle Trachtenberg’s ex-wife took it upon herself to clarify fans on why her marriages never lasted. According to what the Sister’s Act actress said in an interview session, all the blames should be laid at her doorstep as she was never 100 percent committed to any of her marriages.</p><p>Goldberg said she was incapable of feeling the type of love expected from married people and soon realized that she wasn’t even ready for it and does not want any part of it.</p><p>She also talked about her daughter, Alex, occupying the number one position in her heart, thus, it is not available to be given to a spouse. Alex does not just have the priority in her mother’s heart, Whoopi’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren will all take their places before any other person. The actress jokingly said that any would-be lover may have to make do with number nine but truth be told, she doesn’t even have the time for anything romantic again.</p><p>With this confession, Lyle Trachtenberg was vindicated alongside the actress’ other exes.</p><h3><strong>Was Whoopi Goldberg Lyle Trachtenberg’s First Wife?</strong></h3><p>If the records are anything to go by, then, Lyle wasn’t previously married before he met Goldberg. Besides, since he has never been a mainstream celebrity, his previous love life was never deemed interesting enough to arouse public curiosity. Thus, it is difficult to say who and who he dated.</p><p>With that said, we must also acknowledge the fact that Lyle Trachtenberg isn’t the first husband of the celebrity actress. Before she met him, Whoopi has been married and divorced a couple of times. Her first contact with matrimony was in 1973 when she exchanged wedding vows with Alvin Martin. Their union lasted a bit long, ending after six years (in 1979), but not before they gave birth to their only daughter, Alexandra Martin.</p><p>Goldberg next married David Claessen who works and earns a living in the movie industry as a cinematographer. Their nuptials, which took place on September 1st, 1986, only endure for a couple of years before it ended in 1988.</p><h3><strong>Whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Trachtenberg Never Had Children</strong></h3><p>Perhaps because the couple’s marriage lasted for a very short time, they didn’t get the opportunity to have any children. However, while their union lasted, Lyle acted as stepfather to the actress’ only child, Alex Martin; Alex is also part of the movie world as an actress cum movie producer.</p><h2><strong>The Unionist Moved On With His Life?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/01/Lyle-with-his-current-wife-and-daughters-1632684498732-e1673811413643.jpg><p>According to reports, Lyle Trachtenberg waited for three years before getting married for the second time.</p><p>His wife has been identified as Adrianna Belan – a Canadian who earned a living as an actress, but is now working nine to five as a marketing director at a company known as Timothy Cline Insurance.</p><p>An alum of both University of Western Ontario and McGill University, Canada, Adrianna, earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the former and another degree in Public Relations Management from the latter. She once worked with Wolfsdorf Associates as a technical writer and also worked as a producer. As an actress, Belan recorded appearances in Room 6, Alpha Dog, Mostly Ghostly, and more.</p><p>Lyle didn’t let the public know when he got married for the second time, however, his marriage has obviously lasted long. They are proud parents to two children – Natasha and Gabriella Trachtenberg, all girls. While the couple loves to keep their children protected from public scrutiny, the girls have made occasional public appearances with their parents. Belan and Lyle are currently residing in Los Angeles where they are raising their children.</p><h2><strong>What Does Whoopi Goldberg’s Ex-husband Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Lyle Trachtenberg has already graduated from college before he went to pitch his tent with IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees). IATSE is the recognized body that monitors the activities of the entertainment industry. It functions as the labor union in the world of show biz. The body is charged with the responsibility of serving technicians, crafts persons, and artisans in theater, TV, trade shows, and movies.</p><p>We don’t know exactly when Lyle joined IATSE, but by the mid-1990s, he had already attained the status of a popular influential organizer. The IATSE activist gathered notoriety from the body’s troublemaking actions on the sets of independent films. Lyle was akin to a producer’s nightmare as his behavior made several of them lose too much funds.</p><p>Lyle Trachtenberg was particularly harsh on the likes of indie moviemaker Allison Anders in 1995 while she was producing her movie, Grace of My Heart. Alison was barely into the second week of production when Lyle Trachtenberg descended on her with his trouble-making colleagues. It happened that the female moviemaker had non-union crew members in her team when Lyle came in at lunchtime. Denied entry into the catering truck, the IATSE personality’s spirit was not doused one bit as he stood outside listing all the benefits to be derived from joining IATSE.</p><p>Talks became rather extremely intense later and was spiraling into the discussion of embarking on a makeshift strike. However, before lunch was over, the body gained additional 25 members. Alisson and her crew were eventually given the go-ahead order to continue filming following an amicable agreement between unionists and producers.</p><p>Alison’s case was just one out of the deluge of Lyle’s trouble-making activities. The influential organizer’s unpalatable behavior has become the nightmare of movie producers as several of them came out to narrate their experiences.</p><p>Trachtenberg’s bad reputation in IATSE notwithstanding, he has remained one of its active members to date.</p><h3><strong>He was Once an Actor</strong></h3><p>Trachtenberg became an actor at a point in his career life. However, his debut onscreen appearance was a non-acting role recorded during the 21st Annual People’s Choice Award hosted in 1995. By 1996, the aspiring movie and television actor joined the cast of Robert Rodriguez’s action-horror production entitled, From Dusk Till Dawn. On the set of the movie, Lyle depicted himself, sharing the screen with the likes of Hervey Keitel, George Clooney, Juliette Lewis, and more.</p><p>The movie, which is written by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Kurtzman, revolvs around the lives of two convicts who got busy holding people against their will at a vampire-filled truck stop. This particular production turned out to be a huge success, winning seven out of the 13 awards it was nominated for. The recognition garnered by the film effectively introduced Lyle’s acting career.</p><p>The year 1997 was when we saw Lyle Trachtenberg in the docu-movie called Full Tilt Boogie where he portrayed himself (a Union Organizer for I.A.T.S.E.). The production revolved around the makings of his debut movie, Dust Till Dawn.</p><p>Trachtenberg’s final onscreen appearance was witnessed one year later on the set of the John Quinn-written Beach Movie – a comic film where he played the character of the Husky Guy. Lyle appeared with movie greats like Alex DeBoe, Gabrielle Anwar, and more.</p><p>When you consider the number of productions that Lyle graced as an actor, you will agree that none of them pitched the LA native for a long-term career in the industry. The former actor couldn’t last long as an actor and soon, people began to attribute it to all his unionist stints which were always pitching him against movie makers.</p><p>With time, he started making appearances in some movie acknowledgments, receiving special thanks for productions like Girl Fever (2002 ), Up with the Steins (2006), My Name Is Doris (2015), All Sould Day: Dia de los Muertos, Transylmania, House of the Dead 2 (2007), and more.</p><h2><strong>FAQs about Lyle Trachtenberg</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Lyle Trachtenberg?</strong><ul><li>Answer: Lyle Trachtenberg is Whoopi Goldberg’s ex-husband.
