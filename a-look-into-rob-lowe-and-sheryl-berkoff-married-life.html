On July 22, the 58-year-old turned to Instagram and posted a monochromatic photo of his 61-year-old wife with a touching remark.</p><p>“Baby, happy 31st anniversary. Your love has changed my life. You are still as lovely, educated, interesting, kind, and humorous as you were so many years ago. Lifetime loving partners!!”</p><p>Berkoff can be seen standing in front of an ocean with a tank top and cardigan in the shot. She finished off the ensemble with a pair of black aviator sunglasses.&nbsp;Sheryl also shared a black-and-white photo of the couple on her Instagram account to commemorate their wedding day.</p><p>“Love is always present. 31 years in business. Blessed and thankful xoxo Happy Anniversary”</p><p>Rob Lowe and Sheryl Berkoff are parents of two children.</p><h2>Rob Lowe & Sheryl Berkoff’s Relationship History</h2><p>Rob Lowe and Sheryl Berkoff initially met in 1983 when their friends put them up on a blind date. However, things did not work out between the two since they did not want to be in a relationship at the time, so they split up.&nbsp;Fate, on the other hand, had other intentions for the two when they met again in 1990 on the set of Bad Influence, where Sheryl was his makeup artist. Lowe was rehabilitated from drug usage at the time. In a 2021 interview with Entertainment Tonight, he acknowledged his wife for guiding him through that period.</p><p>“[Berkoff] may have saved my life.” She met me at the tail end of my ’80s wild boy madness, and she was worth adjusting my life for.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rob-Lowe-1-1.jpg alt="Rob Lowe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They started dating in 1989 and married on July 22, 1991.&nbsp;Rob Lowe discussed how his life altered after marrying Berkoff in an interview with the news outlet Haute Living.</p><p>“I had met my now-wife, Sheryl, and was taking my first effort at monogamy — which was not in my nature at the time — and I couldn’t do it.” It made me think about how I was spending my life. That led to my being clean, which led to me altering my life and having all I have today.”</p><p>The couple, who are celebrating 31 years of marriage, have two kids, John Owen Lowe and Matthew Edward Lowe. John, who was born in 1993, followed in his father’s footsteps and became an actor. According to his Instagram name, Matthew, who was born in 1995, is an entrepreneur.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rob-Lowe-2.jpg alt="Rob Lowe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, the Code Black actor said that his wife was never uneasy while he was continually showered with attention because of his work. The Wild Bill star told The Guardian in an interview:</p><p>“Well, listen, we would never have been attracted to one other if she hadn’t been a fantastic sport and had tremendous perspective, which she still has to this day.” She’s quite confident in herself, which makes it easier for me to go about my business, and occasionally my job requires me to jump into a bed and kiss a lovely female.”</p><p>Rob Lowe, who was most recently featured in 9-1-1: Lone Star as Owen Strand, will next appear in Dog Gone and Unstable.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmaqn5d6rbvWnmSappRiwKmx0bKjZpqVp7iwssVmpJqqop6ypXnLop2eZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
