But here’s the twist: her family and society aren’t accepting of it. Despite coming from a wealthy & modern family, they can’t handle homosexuality. So, Yuri keeps her relationship with Juliana a secret from everyone.</p><p>One day, things go downhill. A maid catches Yuri and Juliana kissing, and the news spreads like wildfire. To protect their family’s reputation, Yuri’s mom, Jina, kicks Juliana out of KISS. It’s a total mess! But Yuri can’t take it anymore. She’s had enough of pretending and hiding. She comes out to her mom, proudly. Her love for Juliana is special. No one, not even her mom, can change who she is.</p><h2>Who Does Yuri End Up With? Is It Juliana or Kitty?</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>yuri and juliana from xo, kitty<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HqHz9BkEaK</a></p><p>— sapphics like: (@sapphicslike) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 19, 2023</a></p><p>Yuri has had feelings for Juliana for a long time. But things get complicated when Kitty enters the picture. Kitty has no idea about Yuri’s feelings. Yuri, meanwhile, pretends to be in a relationship with Dae. Dae, on the other, is head over heels for Kitty. It’s a messy situation, to say the least.</p><p>But, then comes a twist. Kitty starts seeing Yuri in a different light. She develops feelings for her too. It’s a <strong><a href=#>love triangle</a></strong>, and things get intense. Yuri uncovers a secret about her mom. She understandably gets angry at her for not being honest. However, she also realizes that her mom has finally gotten proud of who she is and totally accepting of her choices.</p><p>In the end, Yuri’s mom reverses Juliana’s expulsion and brings her back to KISS. But there’s heartbreak for Kitty. She gets kicked out too, and it’s devastating. At the airport, she sees Yuri and tries to confess her feelings, but Juliana appears. It’s a bittersweet moment.</p><p>So, for now, Yuri is with Juliana. The key phrase being, ‘for now’. You can bet there will be further drama and love triangles in the <a href=# rel=noopener>potential</a> Season 2. We can’t wait to witness where the story heads in XO, Kitty.</p><p>Before leaving, find out about <a href=#><strong>Kitty’s half-sibling</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>if Anna Cathcart is gay</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKGjYsa2vshmnaunnWLFsHnKoqutsV2crrp7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
