Her solution? Get her ex-boyfriend and costar <strong>Johnny Galecki</strong> to do it for her!</p><p>Not long after Cuoco, 29, accepted her first award, the happy actress returned to the stage with her entire Big Bang Theory cast to accept another award for Favorite TV Show.</p><p>This time it was Galecki, 39, (who plays Dr. Leonard Hofstadter in the hit comedy series) who got to do the talking. But despite being Cuoco’s ex-lover, the actor proved he was still on great terms with his costar, by using the opportunity to make up for his ex’s forgetful faux pas.</p><p>“Hey, just real quick, I’d like to take a brief moment, because Kaley forgot during her speech to thank her husband, Ryan,” Galecki said, kind of awkwardly, while Cuoco gave him a thankful pat on the back.</p><p>“You are my heart, and I can’t imagine what I’d be without you,” Galecki then joked before going on to thank fans more seriously for their support and love for the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Cuoco and Galecki dated for two years in secret back in 2007. But while Galecki has been tight-lipped about their hidden relationship, he did admit this time last year, that he and his former love had managed to maintain a strong friendship.</p><p>“We’re dear friends, still,” Galecki told CBS Watch! Magazine in December 2013. “Kaley’s not just an ex, she’s a part of my life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Galecki went on to attend Cuoco’s wedding to tennis hunk Sweeting, and according to Cuoco, there were no hard feelings.</p><p>“He was in the front row at my wedding, with a huge smile on his face,” Cuoco told <a href=#>Cosmopolitan magazine</a> in April. “It took a minute, a bit of awkwardness,” she admitted, of the transitioning process from boyfriend and girlfriend to best pals. “By the grace of God, we became best buddies and moved on in such an elegant way. [He’s] one of my closest friends.”</p><p>Watch the unlikely moment Galecki thanked Sweeting for his support above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpJilnalisLa7wqiqZp2oYsGprc2kqmZlmKrAo63NnWSrsZGjerTDxJ6roqaXYq61eZFpaG5loJq8sbjErGScoJ%2BesKZ5kWlobnBh</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
