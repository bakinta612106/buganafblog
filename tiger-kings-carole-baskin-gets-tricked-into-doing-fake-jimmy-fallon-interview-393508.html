However, Baskin thought she was going to be on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and it turns out she was tricked by YouTubers Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Pieters and Manners contacted the Big Cat Rescue CEO last month and told her they worked for a production company that booked guests on talk shows. When they first requested the interview, Baskin turned them down because she hasn’t been granting any after the docu-series started streaming.</p><p></p><p>Baskin wasn’t happy with how filmmakers portrayed her in Tiger King, so she has been laying low. But, she changed her mind and granted the interview once they promised her that she would only have to talk about cats instead of bringing up the popular fan theory that she killed her second husband.</p><p>Apparently, Pieters and Manners told Baskin that she wouldn’t be able to see Fallon because he was filming from his home, but she would be able to hear him. To trick her, they downloaded clips of Fallon interviewing celebrities and talking about cats.</p><p>The duo pulled it off, and they posted the interview with Baskin on Saturday. She talked about closing down her cat sanctuary in the middle of the pandemic, and revealed that she had to let half of her staff go. Baskin explained that she and the remaining volunteers were forced to “work double-time” so they could take care of the 55 exotic cats she keeps in her sanctuary.</p><p>“After COVID-19, I just don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to do tours again,” said Baskin.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Carole Baskin Fooled Into First Interview with Fake Fallon Producers <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/NbVxqXHNV6</a></p><p>— TMZ (@TMZ) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 3, 2020</a></p><p>After the interview, Pieters and Manners convinced Baskin to put on her flower crown and introduce a clip that featured pics of her with her third husband, Howard Baskin. She also promoted the Big Cat Safety Act, which is a proposed law that aims to end big cat abuse.</p><p>Baskin says that she isn’t mad about being tricked, and she also claims that she did get suspicious.</p><p>“I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited,” said Baskin.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Tiger King is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeknrSmvoykoKefo2Kwor7OpZxmmpGouKq6jKCcratdqb%2Bqr8qem2ahnqm8brDOoqWgZZaWuKZ5yaKkprFdm66tuM6nZKKmpJq%2Ft7XEsGRscWNqfXl7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
