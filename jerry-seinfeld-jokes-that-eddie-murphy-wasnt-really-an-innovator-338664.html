Before the audience, Jerry described working with Eddie Murphy as being like playing football on a team where Clark Kent is the star player, and then one day, he starts lifting up cars and doing all kinds of things that other people can’t do.</p><p>Jerry went on to say that working with Murphy was not like working with an innovator, because when it comes to working with an innovator, one can actually see how they do it and then do the same thing, however, in Eddie’s case, his style and charisma was unimitable.</p><p>The Raw comedian, who was given the title of Entertainment’s Innovator, just got to the event following a day of filming on the set of his brand new movie, Coming 2 America. Eddie stated he was working on just three hours of sleep.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1pFBprHC58/</p><p>Some of the other big names in the crowd included Bette Midler, Molly Ringwald, Riccardo Tisci, Julianne Moore, Irina Shayk, Gigi Hadid, Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, as well as Kanye West.</p><p>As it was noted above, Eddie Murphy is currently in the middle of working on his latest movie, Coming 2 America, which is a sequel to the original from the 1980s. Coming to America, released in 1988, was created for $39,000,000, and it earned $288.8 million at the box office.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Reportedly, Coming 2 America is coming out on the 18th of December, 2020.
