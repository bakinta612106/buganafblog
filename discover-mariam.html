The track is laden with thought provoking lyrics, soulfully sang across a catchy beat. It is a great first offering from the singer-songwriter, and shows&nbsp;what we can&nbsp;expect from&nbsp;her EP Heart To Heart, which is due for release on November 4.</p><p>Of ‘Be There For Me’, Mariam said: “This song is about unrequited love, it speaks about that moment you realise you can’t make anyone love you or reciprocate affection.” Take a listen to the track below.</p><p>Mariam’s creativity has been evident from a young age, after building her passion for words through poetry and creative pieces. She soon realised that she had a natural gift to combine rhythmic melodies with meaningful words, an ability she credits to her Nigerian heritage. She said,&nbsp;“Nigerians are natural story tellers, it is an art that is passed down and learned within the family and community, hearing stories has been a prominent fixture in my life just as strong as music. Music is such a powerful way to tell stories and relate to others, and I love how words come together to paint pictures”.</p><p>In 2011, Mariam unveiled her music to the world, getting acquainted with the underground scene and playing at open mic nights. She also joined&nbsp;the ‘London Community Gospel Choir’ (who has supported artist such as Tom Jones, Sam Smith and more) and started working on original material with local artists (including British artist Samm Henshaw).</p><p>On November 4, Mariam will release her Heart To Heart EP, a five-track&nbsp;soul, folk and pop infused offering which will truly cement her status as one to watch in the music industry.
