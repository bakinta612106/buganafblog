Victoria Newman’s (Amelia Heinle) trepidation about her father’s well-being is real.</p><p>But the now co-Chief Executive Officer of Newman Enterprises is also understandably miffed. Victoria did what even Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) said was a solid job running the company he founded.</p><p>So, why has Victor decided to step back into the CEO’s spot?</p><h2>The Young and the Restless Spoilers Highlights</h2><p>The cause-and-effect relationship is something school students have studied in elementary school for many years. So, underlings would naturally react to someone above them making erratic business decisions.</p><p>Such has been the case in recent months, with Newman Media being a free-for-all. Many people have been in and out of what became a division of Newman Enterprises.</p><h3>Young And The Restless Spoilers – Disjointed Or Reacting To The Moustache’s Erratic Behavior?</h3><p>Along with the above, Victoria decided that Nate Hastings (Sean Dominic) was going to become her right-hand man. While Victor likes Nate and appreciates his perspective, he finds that element of Victoria’s decision-making questionable.</p><p><strong>MUST READ –&nbsp;<a class="post-title post-url" href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Y&R Spoilers: Who’s The Daddy Shocker For Kyle And Tucker!</a></strong></p><h3>Young And The Restless Spoilers – Victor Newman Is Meddling</h3><p>As he has reinforced, it is Victor’s prerogative to do as he wishes with the business. But the choices he makes regarding his family member’s lives have long been a bone of contention.</p><p>Victor flat-out told Nate that only someone with the Newman name would run the show. That implied while the Moustache was alive.</p><p>Victoria is concerned about her father’s mortality. That emotion is not driven by her feelings about the unpredictable and questionable nature of Victor’s recent business moves.</p><p>It is plausible to believe that Victor wants to spark dissension between Victor and Nate as a possible means to drive them apart.</p><h3>Young And The Restless Spoilers – Nikki Newman’s Proposal Is Wise</h3><p>Nikki’s suggestion, that she and Victor take some time away from Genoa City, Wisconsin, to prepare for the increased time they will be spending at work was wise. Going on a few weeks of vacation and delaying Victor’s official return to the top C-suite creates a needed buffer period.</p><p>While Victoria will not get over what she sees as a demotion, delaying the forced co-CEO scenario until October would allow her to prepare for her father’s presence. In the meantime, she, and Nate would be observed by the classic portrait of Victor that was rehung in what is now his and presumably, Victoria’s office on Y&R.</p><p>This site is a leading source for<a href=# rel=noopener> everything linked to The Young and the Restless.</a> Check back regularly for Y&R spoilers and news!</p><p><strong>For more about what’s happening on your favorite soaps and more ways to connect with us</strong>, join the conversation on our&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook Page</a>, check out our&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter feed</a>, look for an update&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>on our Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>follow us on Threads</a>, or drop us an e-mail&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>HERE!</a>&nbsp;See you there!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49yZq2glWLGsMHNoGSappRiwamxjKucrKycmsC0edKppqKklafAbsLInKuoqpmWeqS7zZycq6aVmXqirs6uq2aumZjBsL7SZqSoqqSWuarA2GaroZ1dory2v9OamqGdo2K5or%2FTZqqtmZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
