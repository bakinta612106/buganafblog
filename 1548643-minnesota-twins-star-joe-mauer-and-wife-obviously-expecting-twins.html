"Everything so far is good."</p><p>The 29-year-old said it was still too early to know if the twins will be boys or girls, so for the moment we will savor the wonder that a man who has played for the Twins for nine seasons is bringing actual twins into the world.&nbsp;</p><p>This is essentially like Mike Trout having an angel, Miguel Cabrera having a tiger or Giancarlo Stanton having a losing ballclub.&nbsp;</p><p>Mauer is coming off a solid season wherein he batted .319 with a WAR of 4.1 according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>, a marked&nbsp;improvement&nbsp;from his shortened 2011 season.&nbsp;</p><p>It's onwards and upwards for a&nbsp;team&nbsp;that won only 66 games last year and finished last in the AL Central Division.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Maddie, Joe met his future wife while both attended Cretin-Derham Hall High School in St. Paul. However, the two were not high school sweethearts, but only began a romantic relationship when they later reconnected, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The two were engaged in December of 2011 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married a year later</a> in a ceremony at&nbsp;Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church, which is located in, you guessed it, St. Paul, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>The theme here is the two like to keep things within Minnesota and confined to one of the Twin Cities. At risk of sounding superfluous, it's absolutely perfect the two are now expecting twins.&nbsp;</p><p>Hit me up on Twitter for more <a href=#>MLB</a> madness.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5saGuBdHnMoqWnnaOkwaJ507Cgp6tdqMGivoyjpp5lnZbCpr6MmqWdZaees6Z5zputoqelqLm6ecSxp56bpJ67qHnTsKCnqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
