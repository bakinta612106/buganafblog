"The better team did not win."</span></span></p><p><span>Following a 1-1 tie after 90 minutes and extra time,&nbsp;</span><span>Lisa Dahlkvist pushed the match-winning penalty kick by Solo for the victory. Dahlkvist's heroics came after&nbsp;<span>Christen Press sent her attempt over the bar, opening the door for Sweden to finish things off.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>There were two disallowed goals during extra time. Carli Lloyd knocked a header into the back of the net in the 115th minute, but she was flagged for pulling down&nbsp;<span>Magdalena&nbsp;</span>Ericsson.&nbsp;</p><p>One minute later, Sweden had a goal from&nbsp;<span>Lotta Schelin</span>&nbsp;taken off the board for being offside.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Sweden did take a 1-0 lead in the 61st minute thanks to a goal from Stina Blackstenius.

The United States has a star-studded roster that on paper would have made it a shoo-in for at least a medal, but on this day, Sweden played a perfect game and took advantage of its openings for its biggest Olympic win in women's soccer.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9tZ2l%2BdXnUrK6nrF2auaq5yKeYrZ2UYrOzu8xmaWlpZmK%2FqruMqKOypaCesLR5wJ%2Brnqpdoby0v4ytpmarp5qxpro%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
