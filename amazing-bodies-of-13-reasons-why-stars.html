"</span><span>I love a hyaluronic acid serum, L'Oreal Paris does a really good one –&nbsp; the Revitalift Filler – and then I usually have a vitamin C and a moisturiser over the top. Then, still sunscreen, of course. I'd say that that's my go-to. And it will change and evolve depending on what I feel like that day."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_599218544.jpg><p><span>Brenda Strong, who plays Nora Walker, wants to speak out about women's health issues, and took part in a campaign for Pfizer.

Now that I'm at or around that age where menopause is one of those stages, I started realizing there was not a lot I personally knew about it, and I was so happy I had the opportunity to not only learn more myself so I could work with other women, but to do it in a way that was funny and create this video with Pfizer for their 'Let's Talk About Change Campaign.'"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1317871181.jpg><p><span>Kate Walsh played Olivia Baker on the first three seasons of the show. She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Coveteur</span></a><span> that she makes sure to stay hydrated. </span><span>"Clearly [I drink a lot of water]—I bring my own water cooler. Lemon is great because the alkaline balances your body. I feel like I'm winning if I drink one of these [jugs] a day, plus a couple more glasses. This will make you do it. It's like a giant sippy cup. Nikki Glaser is like, 'You actually bring your own water cooler—we're having a water cooler conversation right now because you brought yours with you.'"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1386847946-2.jpg><p><span>Alisha Boe played Jessica Davis on the show.

She revealed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Backstage.com</span></a><span> that she believes in saying no to things. "It's about saying no, too. I've had to say no to a lot of things that just didn't resonate with me. I was like, 'You know what? The right thing for me is gonna come. And I'm gonna believe in that.' In this industry, you're going to hear a lot of rejection, as well. And that's OK. That kind of builds character, and it also sets you on a path for success. Because the universe is just lining you up for exactly what is meant for you. And just have fun! We're telling stories! It's the arts! We're having fun! It's not as serious as the industry tries to make it out to be sometimes. Have fun with it and play.

"I've gotten a lot of help from other people when I didn't feel like I could talk to my friends or family. I started going to therapy when I was 18 [after] having personal struggles that I didn't feel comfortable talking to my friends or family about. There are just some things you don't want to talk to certain people about.
