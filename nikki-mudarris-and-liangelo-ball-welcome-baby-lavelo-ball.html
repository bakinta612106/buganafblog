I could have never done it without you by my side. I love you so much I’m so grateful to experience this with you and raise our son together, he’s absolutely perfect. I’m so thankful to have you both. This is just the beginning of the very best chapter yet…”</p><p>Mudarris and Ball had previously revealed their son’s name, which holds special significance.
