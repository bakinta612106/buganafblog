Ever since then, they’ve been in the public eye–and with all of the publicity that they get, it’s natural to wonder how much the Obamas make.</p><p><strong>Barack and Michelle Obama are now rich but have not always been. With Michelle’s work as a lawyer, Barack’s as a politician, and now both of them working as authors and public figures, they’ve become rich, and their net worth is now around 70 million dollars.</strong></p><p>Read on to find out more about Barack and Michelle Obama’s situation and how they’ve been making their money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jobs Past and Present</h2><p>To be <a href=# rel=noopener>considered rich</a>, someone must have a net worth between 2.2 and 2.6 million dollars, according to the generation–<a href=# rel=noopener>Baby Boomers</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Generation X</a> are on the higher side of that range, both at $2.6 million, while Millennials are at $2.2 million. On average, many agree that having a net worth $2.3 million is the baseline for being rich.</p><p>In 2008, when the Obamas were moving into the White House after winning the presidential election, their net worth was about $1.3 million. While they were above the average net worth for American households, they were not considered rich.</p><p>Before becoming a politician, Obama was an author and a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, teaching constitutional law. Michelle Obama worked in marketing and intellectual property law at the law firm <a href=# rel=noopener>Sidley & Austin</a> in Chicago, which is how she met Barack.</p><p>While Michelle Obama was the primary earner when Barack was a senator for Illinois, they switched roles for a time with the presidency, Barack focusing more on his work and Michelle spending more time with their daughters and on the campaign trail.</p><p>When Barack Obama was in office, the family <a href=# rel=noopener>made</a> about 20 million over those eight years. Obama made about 8.8 million dollars from his books, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Audacity of Hope</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Of Thee I Sing: A Letter To My Daughters</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Dreams From My Father</a>, Obama’s memoir that was originally published in 1995, also sold a great deal with his election in 2008 and made about 6.8 million dollars. His presidential salary may have declined over the years, but he made a total of 3.1 million dollars in his time as president, and like all other presidents, receives a <a href=# rel=noopener>pension</a> of about 200,000 dollars a year since the end of his presidency.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Recent Book Deals and Events</h2><p>After Obama’s presidency, he and Michelle both signed book deals worth about 60 million dollars, and Michelle Obama’s bestselling memoir <a href=# rel=noopener>Becoming</a> has sold over 10 million copies and has sold <a href=# rel=noopener>more</a> copies than any other book published in the United States.</p><p>The couple also took a 50 million dollar deal with Netflix after making the documentary version of Michelle’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Becoming</a>.</p><p>Reader and viewer reactions to Becoming were very positive, and fans took to social media to praise them, posting things like <a href=# rel=noopener>this</a> about the documentary, writing that “[h]er humility, dignity, love and intelligence shine through,” or like <a href=# rel=noopener>this</a> about the book, the fan calling it “[o]ne of [her] favorite books that [she] has read in the last year.”</p><p>As public figures, both Barack and Michelle Obama are paid to give talks and speeches to various audiences, which is another way that they’ve reached their current combined <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of 70 million dollars.</p><p>The Obamas <a href=# rel=noopener>donate</a> some of their money to different charities, especially from the proceeds they make from their books. They’re also paying for their daughters’ educations–Malia, who is going to <a href=# rel=noopener>Harvard</a>, and Sasha, who is going to the <a href=# rel=noopener>University of Michigan</a>.</p><p>Check out the YouTube video below to watch the trailer for the Netflix documentary on Michelle Obama’s life, Becoming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jpqpnmWSlr%2Bir8pmpKKbmJq5rbGMqJmapZFiv6qvx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
