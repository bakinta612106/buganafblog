On her social media account, she says that she’s always wanted to compete&nbsp;on Big Brother and now she’ll get to do exactly&nbsp;that. Here’s her exciting announcement below.</p><p>‘Surprise! I’ve been such a huge fan of this show, and finally, I get to compete! Make sure you tune in starting Monday, January 21st to catch me on Celebrity Big Brother on CBS 🙌🏽🙌🏽😘😘😘’ Tamar captioned her post.</p><p>Someone told her ‘@tamarbraxton You better go get them, girl, you know only you can do that good luck lady. ❤️’</p><p>Another follower was also excited to find out the news: ‘@tamarbraxton I thought someone was joking when they told me you were going to be on CBB! Enjoy your time in the BB house!’</p><p>There were also a few haters who popped up in the comments section who said that Tamar is just looking for attention.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BslhmKDhMDp/</p><p>Her diehard fans were quick to defend their idol.</p><p>One fan said that ‘she is a BRAXTON!! She doesn’t NEED THAT kind of attention. She has already made it… she is a Grammy-nominated artist, she is NOT a wannabe… that show is for OTHER PEOPLE, not the BRAXTONS. Her mom is “MISS E”,. for God’s sake….her sister is “The One and Only Grammy-winning @tonibraxton.! Come on….. she shouldn’t be on no dam BB.. if she wants some attention… get her back on the mic, back in the studio… THAT VOICE IS OUR GIFT, THAT VOICE IS FIRE!’</p><p>Another supporter gushed over Tamar as well: ‘You are going to turn that show out!! I’m here for it! Can’t wait.’</p><p>Someone else also praised everything that Tamar does and wrote this: ‘I follow EVERYTHING you do! HUGE FAN! Thank you for ALWAYS being YOU! Hope to meet you one day! ‘</p><p><a href=#>Tamar</a> has been living her best life these days especially since she met another man. She also introduced&nbsp;her son to him, and some of her fans found this a bit inappropriate.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But Tamar made sure to explain to people that even if she has not been dating her new BF for that long, she feels like she has known him forever.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklrqivoybqZqwpKS7tHnFmqWsZZOWu6%2B702aumqGkYsGwedKenGaglad6sLqMnJylnZKntrXFjJugoGWSp7y1tMSrZKimXZivtHnToZyyZZSas6a6w2afnqpdm7%2BwuYyhmK2doqh6uLTOZpqlmZmierS0xGamp6SpYsCmscqsZJqspJq7tbXOp2Rra2Rugnd7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
