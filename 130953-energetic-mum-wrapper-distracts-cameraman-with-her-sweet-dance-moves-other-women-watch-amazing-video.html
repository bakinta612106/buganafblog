She's very good with anchoring Yoruba alaga iduro and ijoko in weddings. Also very good with Anchoring wedding Reception, events and all."<p class=align-left>@jayythedope said:</p>"Normally, this woman deserves to be sprayed a lot of money, but no!!! There’s no man around and women only collect."<p class=align-left>@ClaretUchechi said:</p>"Don't be quick to judge. Maybe they are not allowed to spray money. Like for instance, if you attend a Jehovah witness wedding, you can't spray money but you are allowed to give money In envelope and other gifts."<p class=align-left>@letter_frm_dele said:</p>"If you watch that video you’ll see that the men didn’t notice her dancing but the women watched on.

The video has left <a href=#>people</a> in tears of laughter.</p><p class=align-left>The people of Mzansi love nothing more than to see people happily dancing and proudly showing off moves which tie to their roots.
