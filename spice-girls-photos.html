The single, which sold over 7 million copies, smashed records and catapulted the group to global fame — and criticism.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=#>some have said</a> that by “reducing” the women’s movement to fashion and all-laughs friendship, the group “[wiped] out feminism for a decade.” However, it bears reminding that the Spice Girls may not have even existed had they not practiced the very solidarity they extolled in song at the very beginning.</p><p>Originally, the five young women were meant to compose a group called “Touch,” with Chris and Bob Herbert as their managers. However, upon realizing that the Herberts sought to control their image — and bind them to an unscrupulous contract — they abandoned ship.</p><p>Not only did they leave en masse, they took master recordings of their songs with them. It wasn’t easy street from there, though. It would take the women, originally strangers, half a year before they met and signed with Simon Fuller, who would play a major role in making them one of the most successful female music groups of all time.</p><p>With that, we look back on their buffalo-booted and Union Jacked run, which split up for a time in 2000, in the photos below:</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>The Spice Girls perform during a "Saturday Night Live" dress rehearsal.</span><span class=credit>MARY ELLEN MATTHEWS/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The group poses for the 50th International Film Festival in Cannes.</span><span class=credit>BERTRAND GUAY/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=credit>Sofía Ferrreira/Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>The Spice Girls pose at a Paris hotel in 1997.</span><span class=credit>THOMAS COEX/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Queen Elisabeth II shakes hands with the Spice Girls after a performance at London's Victoria Palace Theatre. </span><span class=credit>AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Prince Harry and Charles (L) pose with Posh and Sporty Spice.</span><span class=credit>WALTER DHLADHLA/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The Spice Girls arrive atop a double decker bus for a screening of their new movie "Spice World" at Planet Hollywood in New York.</span><span class=credit>HENNY RAY ABRAMS/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>A young girl holds the Spice Girls dolls.</span><span class=credit>JOHNNY EGGITT/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=credit>Martin/Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>Spice Girls pose at a photocall at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in 2007.</span><span class=credit>Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The Spice Girls perform at the 2007 Victoria's Secret fashion show.</span><span class=credit>Mark Mainz/Getty Images</span> <span class=credit>Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The Spice Girls perform during the Closing Ceremony on Day 16 of the London 2012 Olympic Games at Olympic Stadium on August 12, 2012.</span><span class=credit>Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Spice Girls Photos In 1997" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-74939356.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> The Spice Girls’ “Girl Power” As Chronicled In Photos View Gallery<p>Enjoy these Spice Girls photos?
