Sure, it’s not why you tune in, but a lot of the time, it’s why you stay. With so much TV on today, something has to stand out – and since the beginning of time, couples have done just that.</p><p><strong>Lucille Ball</strong> and <strong>Desi Arnaz</strong>’s Lucy and Ricky were one of the first onscreen pairs that audiences just couldn’t get enough of, beginning when I Love Lucy debuted in 1951. Married and in love, they had the bickering bit down pat – something that carried on through the years. In fact, it was so popular that it’s sparked the “will-they, won’t-they” theme that appears in nearly every show on TV today.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Joshua Jackson</strong></a>’s Pacey Witter and <a href=#><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a>’ Joey Potter went from “you annoy me” to “I love you” and back again for the entire second half of <a href=#>Dawson’s Creek</a> – and it worked. By the finale, you still weren’t sure if they’d end up together. The same went for <a href=#><strong>Adam Brody</strong></a>’s Seth Cohen and <a href=#><strong>Rachel Bilson</strong></a>’s Summer Roberts on The O.C.

And Rachel said it perfectly in the finale: “This is where I want to be. No more messing around. I don’t want to mess this up again. It’s you and me, all right? This is it.”</p><p>Scroll down for more of our favorite TV couples:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W2pMDUq5ysZ5KawLV5069knKelpbmmv4yonWaZnKF6tbXMnmRraGFofnJ%2BjmtvbGhn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
