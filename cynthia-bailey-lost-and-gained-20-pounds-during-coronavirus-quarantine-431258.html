The 53-year-old RHOA star dished on a bikini photo from July.</p><p>During her chat with Us Magazine, Cynthia explained how the photo was taken right around the same time as her return to Los Angeles. She said she gained twenty pounds during the quarantine.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bailey</a> went on to say that her dress designers weren’t too pleased about it because she no longer fits into her outfit.
