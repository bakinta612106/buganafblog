And why not? Even I had to google Ally Allston and you all know by now that I spend far too much time thinking about Superman. Interestingly, though, it’s good to remember that the more traditional, purple, energy vampire version of Parasite is already part of the Arrowverse, having appeared in a h<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">andful of <strong>Supergirl </strong>episodes</a> already. But that’s Rudy Jones, the original comics Parasite, and assuming no <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></strong> related hiccups, Superman has never had any interaction with him, so maybe we WILL see Ally turn purple at some point.</p><p>That being said, the comics Ally/Parasite comes from a weirdly forgotten but totally underrated run of <strong>Adventures of Superman</strong> comics when Greg Rucka was writing, so it looks like I have some homework to do while this show takes a few weeks off.</p><h2>What is The Inverse Method?</h2><p>We get some more info about Lucy Lane’s attempted suicide in this episode. While the event definitely took place, Lucy doesn’t see it as a suicide attempt, even though it certainly looked that way to Lois. Instead, Lucy claims that she was following Ally’s teachings, in which an individual can “cross over” and meet some kind of other self, with a union presumably healing one’s emotional trauma. Lucy insists that she was practically there, and was indeed seeing her other self when Lois intervened.</p><p>One possibility that struck me, which seems at least a little unlikely considering just how vague this show has been about making its Arrowverse ties more concrete, is that perhaps any legitimacy to Allston’s Inverse Method could involve allowing regular folks to see into the multiverse, or perhaps to see remnants of elements of the multiverse that were destroyed by the Crisis.</p><p>On the other hand, this show is dealing with a literal manifestation of one of its title characters’ other self, so perhaps it’s more reasonable to ask…</p><h2>Is There a Bizarro Connection?</h2><p>Folks, I am as baffled and intrigued by this new Bizarro as you are. What he’s made of, where he comes from, that painful psychic connection he shares with Superman, the fact that this show even managed to turn the goofy “Bizarro #1” amulet from the comics into something cool and that apparently serves a story purpose. Your questions are probably my questions, too.
