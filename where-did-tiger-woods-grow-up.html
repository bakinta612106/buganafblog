Gwen Stefani and Will Ferrell have also lived in the region, which is known for its beaches and extensive coastline.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Born</a> December 30, 1975 in Cypress, Orange County, Woods’ childhood would revolve around the area.</p><p>His father, Earl, was a Vietnam War veteran, and served in the special forces, a position which afforded him access to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Navy golf course</a> in Los Alamitos. Woods spent his childhood playing on local courses in Orange County, but it was this course where his talents would first develop.</p><p>As legend goes, Woods’ interest in golf revealed itself when he was just <a href=# rel=noopener>6 months old</a>, whilst he watched his father practise his swing. He was a child prodigy who played his first hole on a golf course <a href=# rel=noopener>at age 2</a>, and who made his first <a href=# rel=noopener>TV appearance </a>that same year in a putting contest with famous comedian Bob Hope.</p><p>Woods was an only child and grew up spending most of his time with his Dad rather than a group of friends his age. His high school secretary told <a href=# rel=noopener>reporters</a> that “he was a quiet, very polite, very unassuming young man”.</p><p>Earl was an inspiration to Tiger and Woods told <a href=# rel=noopener>The LA Times</a> upon Earl’s death in 2006. “He was an amazing dad, coach, mentor, soldier, husband and friend. I wouldn’t be where I am today without him”, adding “my dad was my best friend and greatest role model”.</p><p>In addition to the Navy golf course near his home, <a href=# rel=noopener>Earl</a> took his son to play at <a href=# rel=noopener>Heartwell Golf Course</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>El Dorado Park</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Dad Miller Golf Course</a>, among others.</p><p>The momentum of Woods’ <a href=# rel=noopener>childhood achievements</a> continued to gain pace, and he spent most of his time either practising or playing in youth tournaments, winning numerous junior ameteur titles, and played his first professional tournament at age 16.</p><p>He finally left his hometown upon enrolling at <a href=# rel=noopener>Stanford University</a> in 1994, although Orange County would remain a familiar and comforting presence. Tiger’s <a href=# rel=noopener>father</a> would continue to live in the house Tiger grew up in until his death.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Legacy</h2><p>Tiger Woods’ career was unprecedented and has secured him a firm place in history books. He won the coveted <a href=# rel=noopener>US Masters Tournament in 1997</a> at the age of just 21, which made him not only the youngest man to win the title but also the first African American to do so.</p><p>After a series of wins in 2019, including that year’s Masters Tournament, Woods tied for the most <a href=# rel=noopener>PGA tour wins of all time</a>, with a staggering 82 wins and it was announced in 2020 that the legend would be inducted into the <a href=# rel=noopener>World Golf Hall of Fame</a>. He said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement</a>, “this achievement is the ultimate recognition to never give up and keep chasing”.</p><p>Beyond his sporting achievements, Woods’ legacy lies in his philanthropic endeavours. The TGR Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father, and is now encompassed by Tiger’s multifaceted enterprise, <a href=# rel=noopener>TGR Ventures</a>.</p><p>The TGR Foundation’s <a href=# rel=noopener>mission</a> is to “to create a world where opportunity is universal and potential is limitless”, and operates a learning centre in his hometown as part of this goal. One of Woods’ other ventures, TGR Live, benefits the foundation through the production of charity events. Clearly, Woods hasn’t forgotten his roots.</p><p>Watch some of the highlights from Tiger Woods’ incredible career in the YouTube video below.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGqsIytoKCdomLEsLvDrGSgqp%2Bsera8jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
