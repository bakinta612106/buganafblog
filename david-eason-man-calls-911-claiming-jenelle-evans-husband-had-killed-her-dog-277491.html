The Sheriff is out there right now investigating and there will be an incident report filed later.’</p><p>On the same day of the call, Jenelle also took to social media to cryptically tell her fans that she was ‘feeling devastated.’</p><p>The reality TV star, who usually defends her husband no matter what, also admitted during the latest episode of the show that David’s firing from Teen Mom over LGBTQ hate comments has managed to put a strain on their marriage.</p><p>According to her, she was not even able to go on a mother-son bonding trip to Kentucky with her son Jace, 9, because David refused unless he could’ve gone as well since he had family there that he wanted to visit.</p><p>But the problem is that if he came along, the MTV cameras would not have been able to document the trip for the show since he is no longer part of it.</p><p>After about a month of posting ambiguous messages about their marriage online, the two finally unfollowed one another on social media.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>This was followed by Jenelle writing on her Facebook account that ‘Better days are coming.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUlsOqsIyemKynnmK6orqMnJilpKNihnJ9jJyjmqGdnruoecmepZ6knJp6psLAp6pmoKWor6K6w2afmpxdoLatuMSdZKGdomKxsLOMa25wbGlmfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
