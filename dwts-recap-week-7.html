The remaining DWTS contestants captured the spirits of specific movie genres in the ballroom on Monday evening. La La Land choreographer Mandy Moore filled in for Julianne on the judges’ panel to critique tonight’s film-themed performances. Although we are still not quite over last week’s heart-wrenching elimination, the show must go on. Find out below who went head-to-head in the dance-off challenge, and which two pairs fell short of advancing to the quarter-finals.</p><p><strong>Bonner and Sharna- Paso Doble&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This dynamic duo served major looks with their Western style routine. Len congratulated Bonner for making it to week seven. He thought the former pro bull rider was a little too wrapped up in being the cowboy; however, came out with guns firing. Mandy is so proud of how far Bonner has come throughout the competition. She thought he completely held his own. Although he doesn’t always provide the content that the other competitors bring to life, he works with what Sharna gives him. Carrie Ann disagreed with Mandy, believing Bonner did get lost in the dance, which ultimately threw off their performance. She also didn’t think he matched up the strength a Paso Doble a should have, but loves how elegant he moves opposed to the other men contenders.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tggze_na0Cg</p><p>Carrie Ann- 7, Len- 7, Mandy- 8, Bruno- 7 = <strong>29/40</strong></p><p><strong>Nancy and Artem- Tango</strong></p><p>Nancy and Artem portrayed the storyline of Pretty Woman so well during their romance focused dance. The former Olympian is showing growth each week and certainly strives to get better. Bruno said it was a grand entrance from a grand lady –&nbsp;glossy, sophisticated, and he just adored the cheekiness. He also commented on how her lines and turns are much better and can vividly see she is listening to the judges’ feedback after every performance. Carrie Ann seconded that, simply advising Nancy to watch her arms as she sometimes loses track of them. Len, who evidently is president of the Nancy Kerrigan fan club, loved the amount of content in their routine and called it a “pretty good tango.”</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtEgIIh9cag</p><p>Carrie Ann- 9, Len- 9, Mandy- 9, Bruno- 9 = <strong>36/40</strong></p><p><strong>Simone and Sasha- Charleston&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The couple’s silent movie Charleston was a smash, really showcasing Simone’s strengths and Sasha’s niche for incorporating astonishing choreography. &nbsp;Bruno thought it was goofy, fun and entertaining, capturing the “fizz’ and “sparkle” of classic silent films. Carrie Ann said it was a really challenging routine and loves how Simone makes everything look so effortless. Len added she puts the moves in movies. He saw great characterization, but would have liked to witness a little more “swivel” on the Charleston. Moving forward, Mandy told Simone to make sure she looks into Sasha’s eyes and enjoys the moment, as she feels her moves are automatic.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6UCwDIK0Nk</p><p>Carrie Ann- 10, Len- 9, Mandy- 9, Bruno- 9 = <strong>37/40</strong></p><p><strong>Nick and Peta- Argentine Tango</strong></p><p>Based on an action genre film, the couple portrayed two badass, sexy spies. Carrie Ann thought it was very hot, saying Nick had moments of extreme brilliance. Although, there were movements when he managed to get ahead of himself. The judge went to explain they would not receive a great score because of quite a few missteps, but all-in-all, she enjoyed it. Len thought there was plenty of attack and aggressiveness, really believing Nick came out and sold the tango routine. Mandy loved the storytelling and for the very first time this season, confessed that she finally stopped watching Nick and began watching a dancer.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggorrNJNdvA</p><p>Carrie Ann- 8, Len- 8, Mandy- 9, Bruno- 9 = <strong>34/40</strong></p><p><strong>Rashad and Emma- Paso Doble</strong></p><p>Rashad and Emma absolutely killed their horror-focused dance (no pun intended). Len thought he and Emma’s performance was simply epic, full of passion and aggression. Bruno said it was a monster smash and liked that it was gothic, rich and most importantly, full of feeling. He added that it was played so well and commended Rashad for reaching every corner in the ballroom. Len agreed, advising the football free agent to be careful about throwing his hands, as well as his lines. Carrie Ann thought the storyline was fantastic, but followed up with Len’s comments and said Rashad’s posture at times slightly broke his lines. She also admitted that she could see him going all the way in this competition. Us too, Carrie Ann, us too!</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3oEPMe1qr0</p><p>Carrie Ann- 9, Len- 9, Mandy- 10, Bruno- 9 = <strong>37/40</strong></p><p><strong>David and Lindsay- Salsa</strong></p><p>Although we watched Lindsay let out a rip in David’s face during the video package, the pair’s Sci-Fi salsa did not exactly blow us away; however, we do commend David’s constant energy on the ballroom floor. Mandy felt he was a little flat on his feet, as they didn’t have just the right spice needed for the routine. Bruno sided with Mandy, telling him to make sure he gets his feet well placed on the floor. Carrie Ann also agreed with the two judges, but appreciated how fun it was and how David executed the content with no mistakes. Len enjoyed watching their routine and the fact it incorporated several touches of salsa.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56YUw-0Evhs</p><p>Carrie Ann- 8, Len- 8, Mandy- 8, Bruno- 8 = 32/40</p><p><strong>Normani and Val- Argentine Tango</strong></p><p>Even with a back injury and a few restraints here and there, Normani still dominates the dance floor. Her stage presence just blows the other contestants out of the water. Not to mention, she’s only 20-years-old. Bruno thought her and Val’s foreign film-themed Argentine Tango was outstanding, as it is classic dances like theirs in which make the show so special. Carrie Ann said Normani dances on all planes, like she’s some inter-dimensional tango space explorer. The judge also added that it is truly an honor to watch the 5H songstress perform every week. Mandy was impressed by Normani’s leg action and commended how much she has grown throughout the competition.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4tG5S_gdnY</p><p>Carrie Ann-10, Len- 10, Bruno- 10, Mandy- 10, Bruno- 10 = <strong>40/40</strong></p><p>By earning a perfect score, Normani and Val topped the leaderboard and received immunity. Since they were safe from elimination, the couple would not have to participate in the pointless dance-off for extra points. Here is how the other contenders paired up:</p><p><strong>Simone and Sasha vs Nancy and Artem- Cha Cha</strong></p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Simone and Sasha, 4-0. America agreed with the judges and chose Simone and Sasha as the winners with 63 percent of the vote.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azSpZYurx1U</p><p><strong>Emma and Rashad vs David and Lindsay- Jive</strong></p><p><strong>Winner:</strong>&nbsp;Rashad and Emma, 4-0. Although it was a close vote, viewed at home declared the couple victorious too, with 53 percent of the vote.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sZ_xr8lN1I</p><p><strong>Bonner and Sharna vs Nick and Peta- Rumba</strong></p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Bonner and Sharna, 3-1. America favored Bonner and Sharna as well, with 64 percent of the vote.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIZb_0tKAZs</p><p><strong>Results time:</strong> We wound up saying goodbye to both Nick and Peta and Nancy and Artem. Although we don’t necessarily agree that it was the right call, we can’t say we are surprised. If there is anything we learned from losing Heather last week, it’s that no one is safe from elimination.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CznfjrwfKkY</p><p>Dancing with the Stars airs Monday nights at 8/7c on ABC.</p><p><strong>Which couple are you rooting for?
