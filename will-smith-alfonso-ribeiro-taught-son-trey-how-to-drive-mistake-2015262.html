So Trey goes and he takes all the lessons, and he learns how to catch the car if it drifts and slides.”</p><p>His grand scheme, however, was a bust. “Then, I get a call from the pastor of the church,” Smith shared, “that he was doing donuts in the church parking lot! This is a lesson to the parents: Do not educate your kids.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Years down the line, Uncle Will might have to return the favor as Ribeiro is currently expecting his second child with wife <strong>Angela Unkrich</strong>. The DWTS winner attended Tuesday’s Hollywood premiere of Focus with his pregnant wife, and updated <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> and other reporters on how they’re prepping.</p><p>“I do whatever [my wife] tells me,” Ribeiro, 43, told <strong>Us</strong>. “I do whatever she tells me. It’s her birthday today. So this morning, a little breakfast in bed, that kind of stuff, just to take care of her, do the things that we’re supposed to do.”</p><p>Watch the funny clip above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK6ipJxiwK6106FkmqSWpLu0u4yroJudmae8bsDArp6hrF2ovK9506ucsmWYpMRuwM5mm6uhppp6rrXSrZiknV1nfXKBkW9p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
