in the South China Sea on Wednesday to challenge China’s claim over the region.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The freedom-of-navigation operation, 500km offshore from Vietnam, was a deliberate

resources that the US military can call on.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s becoming increasingly difficult – Australia is to a degree isolated,’ Prof Rothwell of Australian National University told the ABC.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is clear there is a pattern associated with Australia’s activities now [that is] very much aligned with the way in which the United States conducts similar activities.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It needs to be accepted that Australia is often sailing through those waters on their own without a lot of back-up, in the way that the US Navy would often have.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The fears were echoed by former defence personnel minister Darren Chester.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘What concerns me is there’s more likely to be some incident at a future point resulting from a level of misadventure or miscalculation or mistake being made than an actual act of aggression,’ the Nationals MP said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We need to be very careful and need to make sure we are working closely with our allies. I think it is really important that we try and de-escalate these situations wherever possible.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At the same time, we have every right to be there. The Australian navy is incredibly professional, incredibly well-trained and incredibly capable and they are just doing their job.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-863a9e22bc1e2b3d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/13/23/60205349-11011567-image-a-2_1657752600696.jpg height=416 width=634 alt="In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane's jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane’s jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In May, a Chinese jet fighter released aluminium foil chaff dangerously close to an RAAF Poseidon surveillance plane’s jet engines, prompting a diplomatic incident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And another Australian Poseidon surveillance aircraft was targeted by high-powered military lasers from a Chinese ship off the north coast of Australia in February.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the federal election campaign, the ADF was also tracking a Chinese naval ship off the west coast of Australia, apparently monitoring military signal traffic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On Sunday, four&nbsp;USAF B-2A stealth bombers landed in Queensland&nbsp;in a high-profile show of strength and support for Australia.</p><img decoding=async id=i-61a10a3ceda8ca05 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/13/23/60242193-11011567-image-m-10_1657753154345.jpg height=483 width=634 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>On Sunday, four USAF B-2A stealth bombers landed in Queensland in a high-profile show of strength and support for Australia</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ‘flying wing’-style aircraft flew 14,000km from their US base in Missouri&nbsp;on a ‘training and strategic deterrence mission&nbsp;in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Squadron commander Lieutenant Colonel Kousgaard added: ‘This deployment of the B-2 to Australia demonstrates and enhances the readiness and lethality of our long-range penetrating strike force.’&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkarAtb7ApaCaZZOdtq%2BtjK2cp6uZpLu0edKpmKujXaiys7XOrqpmoZ6YtqWxza1kn52Rp3qistOeqWaonJZ6rrXLoquaqqlisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYq6lsoynmK%2BxXayus7%2FHoqdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
