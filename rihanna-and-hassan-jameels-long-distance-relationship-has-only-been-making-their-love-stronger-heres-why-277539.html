In fact, one insider report claims they’ve used the distance to their advantage!</p><p>There is no doubt that long distance relationships are hard to navigate for many but that is not the case with Rihanna and her boyfriend who are still going strong!</p><p>In their case, they actually enjoy their personal space quite a lot and the fact that they get it has helped bring balance to their romance.</p><p>One source tells HollywoodLife that ‘Rihanna and Hassan are not joined at the hip at all, they spend a lot of time apart but it’s not a sign of trouble. She loves that he gives her lots of space and freedom to maintain her own identity and career. He doesn’t put pressure on her the way guys she’s been with in the past have done, she’s entirely free to be herself.’</p><p>‘A lot of couples might be torn apart by the long distance but it actually really works for them and makes them stronger as a couple. They do spend way more time together than people realize. They meet up a lot in Paris because it’s the perfect midpoint for both of them. She loves it there, she gets so much more privacy.’</p><p>Besides, Paris really works for Rihanna’s career as well since she has been focusing on her fashion brand a lot.</p><p>But because she’s the one always in another part of the world, he has been the one traveling the most to get to her and spend time together.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The insider mentioned that he really does put in the effort so that is great!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinrWius2aZJqmlGK1or%2FSmqVmopGisqa40majqKaXYrGqv9OapZydXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW60wKxkqKacrnqjscSnZKaZm567qHnToZyiql2hvLexjKyrq6eenLKzeceeqZ6rXay1unmRcG5ua2lk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
