(Seriously, it’s like a Disney Pinterest board come to life.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In fact, the fun started even before the event did, with a fun, interactive invitation designed by Harper Gray. Guests received a gift box with Minnie Mouse confetti and a balloon, which they had to inflate in order to get the party details.</p><p>“All of our friends have kids, so it was a ton of fun to get everyone together to celebrate Riley,” Molly tells <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> of the Jenny Keller-planned shindig, which was held at the play space ROMP in Bellevue, Wash. “Of course, our families were also at the party. Riley was most excited to see her best friend, Palmer, from daycare.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Both Molly and her hubby sported Minnie and Mickey Mouse-themed shirts, respectively, while Riley donned Minnie’s signature red-and-white dress, a red bow-adorned pair of black mouse ears, white knit tights, and red socks with Minnie’s face on them. Similar socks and mouse ears were also available to guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“This was, hands down, my favorite detail!” Molly tells <strong>Us</strong> of the ears. “It set the tone and got everyone in the mood!”</p><p>Food-wise, there was a make-your-own “Hot Diggity Dog” bar, as well as a table full of Minnie Mouse-themed sweets from Keller, including cookies, Rice Krispie treats, cupcakes, and cake balls — all of which had Minnie’s trademark mouse ears and red bow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The piece de resistance, though, was a beautifully frosted two-tier red velvet cake topped with fondant mouse ears and a polka-dotted bow, which the birthday girl and her guests ate off of — you guessed it — Minnie Mouse plates. (Even the mason jar cups came with pretty red lids and Minnie-printed paper straws.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Elsewhere at the bash, there were craft stations where invitees could make beaded necklaces or design their own little hair bows. Those were a hit with some of the older kids, as was the Pinterest-worthy photo booth, which featured a white sequined backdrop and lots of fun props and signs for guests to use. And for the younger kids, there was a play area with balls, giant blocks, and a short wooden slide.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I loved this location because it allowed all of the kids to run free and play with all of the toys and books while the adults sat in eyesight of the kids and mingled, ate, and drank in the community kitchen/dining space,” Molly raves. “It truly is the best location for a kids party! The little ones were self-entertained and everything is kid-friendly, so it was a stress-free space for the parents.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Molly and Jason also provided special goody bags with stickers, hair ties, temporary tattoos, bubble bath, beach totes, Mabel’s Labels name tags, personalized M&Ms, and (for the adults!) certificates for Net Nanny, a software company that helps parents manage their kids’ computer activity.</p><p>Married since 2010, Jason and Molly welcomed daughter Riley Anne on March 14, 2013. The Seattle-area former Bachelor is also dad to son Ty, 10, from a previous marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGaq5%2BjeqK6w2akqKScrnqusdKnoJyjXam1s7HWZphmnKKarq55w6Kqp52pYr2ivtOyZJ%2BnomKxosHGoaueql2ntq2x2GZpaWllZoV0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
