In fact, that’s the girl she played on “Dawson’s Creek,” the show that shot her into fame and stardom. She’s been reserved, quiet and very private about her life until a few years ago when she made the decision to enter into a relationship with one of the most famous men in the world. Her life became a lot more public when she married and had a child with Tom Cruise, but she’s since divorced the star and gone back to her ways of staying private and mostly keeping herself and her daughter out of the spotlight.</p><p>Now 35, the actress was in Malibu this week with her parents, where she opened up about the fact that she’s grown up in a very reserved household. It’s not often she speaks of her family and her childhood, so it always causes her fans to stop and listen when she does offer a little about her past life.</p><p>“I’m from a very reserved family. You kind of grow up just doing what you do and not talking about it and moving on,” she says of her upbringing. It makes sense that she’s this way considering she’s never been one to brag, seek out the limelight or even discuss her life in great detail. While we may not know much about her life as a child, she has offered up information that she was a happy kid in a good home, that she has a supportive family, and she has leaned heavily on them since her divorce from Tom Cruise, which speaks volumes about the fact that her family is very reserved, welcoming and loving. None have spoken out about her private life to the media, even though some families of stars tend to do that for a bit of their own fame.</p><p>Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for The Weinstein Company</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiimqyZmnqpu8umnKxln6Wyr7%2BMoKmor5mjtG6ywKagpbFdobassY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
