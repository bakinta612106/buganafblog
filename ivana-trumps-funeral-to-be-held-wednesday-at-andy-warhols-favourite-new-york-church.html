(17.06.22)</p><p>An insider said: “Donald talked to her regularly and sent flowers on every birthday and other occasions. I’m told he’s very upset.”</p><p>Donald used his Truth platform to announce on Thursday (14.07.22) his first wife and mother of his three adult children had died at her home near Central Park on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.</p><p>The NYPD confirmed it responded to a call at around 12.40pm local time of a person in cardiac arrest at 10 East 64th Street.</p><p>It said the death had no criminal element.</p><p>Ivana’s death was ruled an accident, with the New York City’s chief medical examiner saying it was result of “blunt impact injuries to her torso” after it was reported she was found at the bottom of her stairs.</p><p>Ivana’s son Eric Trump, 38, has been seen regularly visiting his mother’s home since her death.</p><p>His sister Ivanka has paid tribute to their mother, calling her “bold” and adding she was “the person to go to”.</p><p>She recalled: ”If need be she’d act as the housekeeper. And did. Be the one to wash the dishes – and did.”</p><p>Ivana and Donald, who married in 1977 and divorced in 1992, shared three children together – Donald Jr, 44, Ivanka, 40, and Eric – as well as 10 grandchildren.</p><p>Donald said: “Her pride and joy were her three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. “She was so proud of them, as we were all so proud of her. Rest In Peace, Ivana!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOoq2appFiwbPBzKmqZp6lo7Kzrctmq6hlkpp6qbHLnWSwnZSjsrSwwLJkmqxdlrulxYywmKugn6HAbrLAr6auqpmpsm66xLBksqeioHqktNSrmqFn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
