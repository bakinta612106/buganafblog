BUT I just wanted to share this with everyone, so you can see how homophobia is still SO PRESENT in our society!!”</p><p>After Sam posted the rant on his Instagram, many of his followers praised him and said they were proud of how he isn’t fazed by the immature page. Many of his fans quickly reported the account which eventually got shut down.</p><p>Sam has been one to talk about homophobic attacks that have been set against him in the past, saying that he had been bullied whilst in high school.</p><p>The fact that it is 2015 and there are still people out there who continue to bash people based on their sexuality is disgusting. Even massive steps have been taken and countries like America have now legalised gay marriage and there are still people out there who deliberately set out to upset people just because of which sex they are attracted to. There is literally no need for anything like this, people should be allowed to embrace who they are without having to worry about backlash from other people.</p><p>Sam Smith has also just recently visited the waxwork of himself at the Madame Tussauds in San Francisco. The chart-topping singer was seen taking selfies with his wax figure and also giving it a little cheeky kiss (and lick)&nbsp;on the cheek. Ahhh, we just love him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sam-smith-stands-up-to-homophobia-01-320x190.jpg alt="SAM SMITH STANDS UP TO HOMOPHOBIA 1" width=360 height=255 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwKK5jKykoqyYYr%2Bmv8%2BopZ2rXam8brTOpqapoJ%2BXtqJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
