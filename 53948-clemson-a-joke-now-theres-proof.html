The Georgia student opens his lunch box and says, "A hot-dog again! If I have to eat one more hot-dog I'm going to jump off this bridge!"</p><p>The Florida student then opens his lunch box and exclaims, "Salad again! If I have to eat salad one more time I'm going to jump too!"</p><p>Lastly the Clemson student opens his lunchbox and complains, "Peanut butter and jelly! If I get peanut butter and jelly one more time I'm going to end it all too!"</p><p>The next day the Georgia student finds another hot dog and jumps...the Florida student got salad again and threw himself off the bridge too...finally the Clemson student finds peanut butter and jelly again and jumps to his demise as well.</p><p>Later when the three mothers were grieving the Georgia mother cries, "If I had only known he didn't like hot dogs, " and the Florida mother cried, "I thought salad was good for him." The Clemson mother then exclaimed, "I don't understand...he fixed his own lunch every day!"</p><p>Have a joke about a team you'd like to add?
