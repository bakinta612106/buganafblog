It’s apparent from the photographs that Gabrielle and Dwayne extended a heartfelt welcome to Hudson as he joined them in the celebration.</p><p>It was on February 11, 2020, that Zaya made national headlines when her NBA star father revealed that she is transgender during an episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p>Back then,&nbsp;Dwyane Wade<strong>&nbsp;</strong>declared, “We are proud parents of a child who is a member of the LGBTQ+ community.” “We’re also proud allies,” said the group. The responsibilities and obligations that we have as parents are extremely important to us. So, whether our child comes home with a question, an issue, or anything else, it is our responsibility as parents to listen to them and provide them with the greatest knowledge and feedback that we are able to provide. That doesn’t change because sexuality is involved in the situation at hand. Once Zaya, our 12-year-old daughter, returned home… and said, ‘Hey, I’d like to speak with you guys because I believe that going forward, I’m ready to live my truth.’ I would like to be referred to as she and her. I would like it if you could refer to me as Zaya.’ It is now our responsibility, both within and externally, to seek out information.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>In 2021, former First Lady <a title="Michelle Obama Addresses Donald Trump’s Racist ‘Send Her Back’ Chant, Will Barack Obama Do The Same?" href=#><strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a> made time out of her busy schedule to speak with Zaya, expressing heartfelt gratitude to the young social media influencer for serving as such a positive role model. The compliments continued: “I am just so proud of you, you know, for being such a wonderful role model and for embracing your truth.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeqlsaiedaam55lmJaxbq2MsKannJWns7a4jJ6YrKyVp3q4scSknKecXay2tbSMn5imoZyuenZ9l29oa2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
