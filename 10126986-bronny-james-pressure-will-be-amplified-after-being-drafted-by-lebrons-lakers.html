I've already seen it on social media and stuff on the internet, talking about how I might not deserve an opportunity," James said Tuesday. "But I've been dealing with stuff like this my whole life, so it's nothing different. It's more amplified for sure, but we'll get through it."</p>NBA TV <span class=acct>@NBATV</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I've been dealing with stuff like this for my whole life.

He averaged 4.8 points. 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 25 games after missing the first month of the season while recovering from heart surgery.</p><p>James went into cardiac arrest last July while practicing at USC and was subsequently found to have a congenital heart defect. The NBA cleared James to play before the league's scouting combine.</p><p>The answer to whether Bronny James deserves an NBA spot will be determined by his play. There is little question the influence of being LeBron James' son played a factor in him being selected in the draft. It's rare for a 36.6 percent shooter to find himself with guaranteed money upon his arrival.</p><p>One could surmise it's the cost of doing business with arguably the greatest player in NBA history, but Bronny will now have every opportunity to prove his worth on the floor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmuGeYKMm6mopp6uequtzJ6qZqiimsC0wdGeZLChnKF6o7GMmqSppJmbtqawjJqdrZ2iYq%2Bmtc2gZJ2qkZvBprCMm7BmpJWXv7C60majmqOVp8A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
