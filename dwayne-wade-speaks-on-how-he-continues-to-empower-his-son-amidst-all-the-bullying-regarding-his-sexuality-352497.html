He always stood by his 12-year-old son, Zion, no matter what, and Gabrielle Union also offered her complete support at all times.</p><p>Check out a video shared by The Shade Room in which Dwyane speaks about how he’s supporting his kids, especially Zion, whose sexuality has brought their family some harsh criticisms.</p><p>What he had to say in the clip triggered a massive debate in the comments.</p><p>Someone showed support and said: ‘This is the type of energy we need from the black community all 2020!!!’ while another follower posted this: ‘All yall talking about you dont support this and couldn’t be your child are horrible. Imagine raising your children in an environment where they can’t be honest and open with you or themselves. It’s going to drive them into a depression.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Ret_ihC6w/</p><p>One other commenter wrote: ‘The agenda that they’re pushing is beyond me. I think he is living vicariously through his son. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Listen, God makes no mistakes.’</p><p>A person does not agree and said: ‘I’m a have to Respectfully disagree with him and rest of y’all! How can I be a man of GOD and accept that? No way Jose 🙅🏾‍♂️. We have to teach the children about the afterlife as well.’</p><p>Someone else posted that he ‘had me listening till he called his son a she .. he still got a dic* at the end of the day don’t let the clothes go over ya head 😂’</p><p>An Instagrammer showed complete support for the family and wrote: ‘I’m all for the love and support, but he ain’t even bust his first nut yet. Wait until he gets in the box for the first time. He will throw away all the heels and press on’s. 😂’</p><p>One other commenter said: ‘Speak to ‘em. You don’t abandon your duty or responsibilities of the role that god has blessed you with because your child doesn’t live up to what you want them to be. Teach them Wade 🙏🏾’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What’s your opinion on Wade’s parenting?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUrK66usRmrpqclWLAsbHApKpmp55itbDDjKGcZpufo8GqutSeqmasn2KyrrzOsJyrZZiewG6%2FzqdkmqWZmcC1ecClo2asmJp6o8HLpbCippdiv6azwKuboqaXYrWqv4ysnLGtkaG2tcWMbGxrbGlsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
