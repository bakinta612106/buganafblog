Awful,” Barnes continued, adding that Americans ought to commit themselves to doing everything possible to repairing the harms of the past.</p><p>These harms, he said, include slavery and colonization, the impacts of which “are felt today.”</p><p>“They’re going to continue to be felt unless we address it, in a meaningful way,” Barnes said.</p><p><strong>ARIZONA DEMOCRATS PROMOTE ‘F*** THE FOURTH’ EVENT TO ‘MOURN’ SUPREME COURT ABORTION DECISION</strong></p><p>Barnes made history in 2018 to become Wisconsin’s first Black lieutenant governor. He grabbed national attention in 2020 in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as he pushed for police reform and an end to racial inequity.</p><p>Last summer, Barnes announced his candidacy to unseat Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in the November midterms. Wisconsin will be a crucial battleground in the elections and could end up deciding which party controls the chamber. &nbsp;</p><p>In a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for Barnes’ campaign said, “Painting the Lt. Governor’s comment as anything other than a condemnation of slavery is a sad GOP attempt to distract from Ron Johnson trying to literally overthrow the government of this country and strip reproductive rights from millions of Americans.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></p><p>The winner of the Aug. 9 Democratic primary will advance to face Johnson, who is seeking a third term after previously promising to not run again.
