He knows the kind of woman that she is and loves that she is so passionate. He is just happy he was able to convince her to take him back. Offset loves Cardi and all the crazy stuff that she does. He knows how she works and the passion they have for each other really makes them go a little overboard to make a point.’</p><p>At the same time, the source claims he knew she was serious about the divorce but also knows how ‘seriously she falls in love.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Furthermore, regardless of how many arguments they get in, Offset knows they are just perfect for each other.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGefm7O0sdNmqZ6on6fBprDLsmSrnZGhubp5x5qnqbFdmK6zsMhmmWasn6S4brTIpmSbmZOgeqmxjK2foqabqHq1tMSyqZ5loJq%2Fp7HCrWSfp6JisqKvx2amraCVp3p1gJZwaGtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
