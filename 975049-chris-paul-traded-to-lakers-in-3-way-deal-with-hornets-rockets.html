Those picks will be a future first- and second-round pick, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to David Aldridge</a>.</p><p>This is clearly a winning trade for the Lakers, as the team was able to retain incumbent center Andrew Bynum, and can now turn around and dangle him in a potential trade package headlined by <a href=#>Dwight Howard</a>.</p><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN's Chris Broussard</a> reported that the Lakers were looking to acquire both Paul and Howard, many laughed off his report as a frivolous one, but now that plan is two-thirds toward being complete.</p><p>The Lakers will boast one of the more intimidating starting units in the league with Paul and <a href=#>Kobe Bryant</a> sharing the same backcourt, but the team did give up its competitive advantage in the size department with the departure of both Gasol and Odom.</p><p>For New Orleans, the team will be looking to rebuild around a legitimate scorer in Martin, and the arrival of Scola will give the Hornets a tough front line when paired with Emeka Okafor.</p><p>Houston has been desperate to upgrade in the size department for several seasons, and Gasol gives the Rockets exactly that.</p><p>There's no doubt that this deal will shift the chances of the Lakers returning to the top of the Western Conference once again, and this is a group that will look awfully different than they have in previous seasons when the action tips off on Christmas Day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJocHBtYGmGbq%2FHq6CsZaCWwq1506uYnZ2UYsGwecuaop6qo2K2r3mSZq6asV2ZsqK4jLCgraBdnbyzusStqmaqn5i4psDS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
