But she still wasn't prepared for the amount of vomit she'd have to face as a new mom to son <strong>Phoenix</strong>, 8 months, and daughter <strong>Lukensia</strong>, 2, her children with partner <strong>Heidi Rhoades</strong>.</p><p>"Oh my God, the puking!" she exclaimed to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at a Television Critics Association cocktail party for the weight-loss competition series on Jan. 6. "I did not anticipate how much a child under 1 [year old] throws up! Every day. Every day! I just look at him, [like], 'Phoenix, honey, when do you stop puking?' I'm told it's after a year. But there isn't a day that I don't get projectile vomited on."</p><p>And that's not the only bodily fluid the mother-of-two has to deal with. Talking with <strong>Us</strong> about life with her infant son — who was born May 3, 2012 — Michaels recalled an incident in which the little boy's diaper exploded all over the wall of a physical therapist's office.</p><p>"I just died inside that day!" she said. "He was like, 'It's okay, I have two kids.' [But] we've never gone back."</p><p>The 38-year-old personal trainer is looking forward to when Phoenix is a little older. And not just because she's eager to get past the vomiting stage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I have this vision of doing [parkour, an obstacle course-style exercise] with my son one day," she told <strong>Us</strong>. "I'll tell him, 'We're gonna do Brazilian Jujitsu together, we're going to do parkour together!' And he'll be like, 'Mom, I want to take ballet!'"</p><p>Michaels also has big plans for daughter Lukensia, whom she adopted last year. Speaking to Redbook in September 2012, the new mom <a href=#>said</a>, "We talk about role models for her, like <strong>Beyonce</strong>, who has a more curvaceous figure. My taste has changed."</p><p>So has her life, thanks to one fateful trip to Haiti. "I was visiting this one orphanage, and the next thing I knew, she jumped into my arms," the trainer told Ladies' Home Journal of her little girl. "She just grabbed me and clung to me and I immediately felt something. I was like, 'Oh my God, this is my daughter.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGipJyerq95zKKaoZmVocBuu81mpKismJq%2FqbvOnWSiZZiWsW66zmagnZ2RYrWww4ymrJygXZi1qrjDq5ynZaakuqrAjGtnamtoZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
