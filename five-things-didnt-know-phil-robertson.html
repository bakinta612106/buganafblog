In one of the greatest mysteries this world has ever known, the Robertson family became an incredible sensation and A&E cashed in on the immense popularity of the show. If you’re familiar with the show you know the Duck Commander Phil Robertson. As the patriarch of the family, Robertson was the centerpiece of the hit show, which appears to have lost its luster. The information above is pretty much common knowledge if you’ve heard of Duck Dynasty. You’re also probably familiar with the fact that it was Robertson who publicly made improper homosexual comments and that may be a driving force toward ending the Dynasty. So before we lost the Dynasty completely, let’s take one last look at the now highly-controversial figure, Mr. Phil Robertson.</p><p>Here are a few things that you may not know about him…</p><p><strong>Net Worth</strong></p><p>Usually we open with the subject’s net worth, but for most this is truly a mystery. Most are familiar with Phil Robertson. Most know about Duck Dynasty. However, most have no clue as to what his net worth would be. I would have guessed $5 million…. and I would have been wrong. Phil Robertson’s net worth is $15 million. Even through his nine day suspension from the television show, Robertson has enough behind his A&E contract and other ventures to have a pretty strong net worth.</p><p><strong>Star Athlete</strong></p><p>If there’s such a thing as the most-known unknown fact about Phil Robertson it’s that he was a star athlete. The Duck Commander was all-state in football, baseball and track and went on to Louisiana Tech to star as their quarterback. Oh and by the way, he was the starter ahead of future Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw.</p><p><strong>Star Athlete Conflicts</strong></p><p>Probably the most astonishing fact about Phil Robertson was that he turned down a chance to play for the Washington Redskins because is conflicted with his hunting. Repeat – it conflicted with his hunting. Football was only about holding up his college scholarship. His famous quote is “Terry went for the bucks and I went for the ducks”.</p><p><strong>Scholar?</strong></p><p>Let’s be honest, we all know the guy isn’t stupid. Look what he’s built for himself. He may be disguised as stupid, but he’s not and there’s proof. Not only does he have a bachelor’s degree in physical education, he has a master’s degree in education. Sure that doesn’t mean he’s going to be a business magnate, but he surely has a brain in his head.</p><p><strong>Inventor?</strong></p><p>In case you needed further proof he wasn’t stupid, he’s also an inventor. Now he didn’t invent the light bulb, but he invented the Duck Commander Call in 1972, received a patent for his call and then incorporated Duck Commander Company in 1973. All because he was dissatisfied with the state of duck calls.</p><p>Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYsGptc2gqmacmZm7tXnKp6awZaCdtq150aiZnqqkqLyvew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
