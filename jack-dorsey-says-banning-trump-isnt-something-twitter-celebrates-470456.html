You can check out what Jack had to say in the post shown below:</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CKCaD7yHJTg/</p><p>As most know, this wouldn’t be the first time <a href=# title="Rihanna And Jack Dorsey Drop Millions In Aid For Domestic Violence Victims"><strong>Jack Dorsey</strong></a> and Twitter have come under fire for censorship-like actions. During the days leading up to the 2020 presidential election, it was reported that Twitter had squashed a story that would’ve had a negative effect on Joe Biden’s run for the presidency.</p><p>Jack famously did an interview over Zoom with several Republican Senators and politicians, including Ted Cruz, who asked Jack if he thought Twitter had an impact on elections.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Jack responded that it didn’t because people had the choice to use other platforms if they chose. Ted looked at him incredulously. The conversation – as well as Jack Dorsey’s beard and nose-ring – later become a source for many memes on the internet.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGealrCsecOoqaydqWLAosXSZpmapp6eu6h506uspqhdnsCvwIyspqadpJ22r7OMra6irKSav26vxKWcm6qRqbK0eZNwZ21tZmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
