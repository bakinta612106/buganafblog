The other, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Olympic</a>, was involved in two devastating collisions but managed to stay afloat.</p><p>And one woman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Violet Jessop</a>, was unlucky enough to have been aboard all three ships as they met with disaster.</p><p>Violet Jessop was an ocean-liner stewardess, and by the time the Titanic struck the iceberg on April 14, 1912, Jessop had already survived one near-fatal accident at sea.</p><p>Less than a year earlier, she had been aboard the RMS Olympic when it collided with the HMS Hawke, a British warship that tore a massive hole in the luxury liner’s side. The watertight compartments the White Star ships were famous for held, and the ship made it to port.</p><p>But the Titanic wasn’t so lucky. As the ship went down, Jessop, now a veteran of calamity, was ordered to the top deck to help non-English speaking passengers. According to her memoirs, she loaded the lifeboats and modeled calm, orderly behavior until she was eventually commanded to board Lifeboat 16.</p><p>As the boat was being lowered into the water, one of the officers gave Jessop a baby to look after. After a long night on the ocean, both she and the baby made it to the rescue ship, where a woman, presumably the baby’s mother, grabbed the child and ran off without saying a word.</p><p>Jessop retired from her maritime career in 1950 with the nickname “Miss Unsinkable.” She died in 1971 at age 83.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1tdOapaKbXajCs8LIr6arq19p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
