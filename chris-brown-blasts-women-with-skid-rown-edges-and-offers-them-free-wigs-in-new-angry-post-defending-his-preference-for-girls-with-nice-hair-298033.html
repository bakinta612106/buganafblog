The scandal erupted after the R&B crooner dropped his new album Indigo.</p><p>One of the 32 tracks, which is titled “Need A Stack” featuring Lil Wayne and Joyner Lucas, has captured the Internet’s attention for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>The lyrics go like this: “Diggin’ it, then I’m lickin’ all on that p****, put it right there/ Only wanna f*** the black b****** with the nice hair.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BxM5a4dB4Ss/</p><p>Chris defended himself and his lyrics: “Yall tripping trippin. Y’all bitches don’t wanna f*ck da ni*ga wit da f*cked up teeth, do you??? Only b*tches upset is the uglies (not the black queens).”</p><p>Chris was not done; he bashed the woman going after him by telling them he will soon give out free lace front wigs because they have skid row edges and low self-esteem.</p><p>Here are Chris’ degrading words:</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzZVm6KFofO/</p><p>This person decided to defend the singer: “It’s never that deep…we dislike men who’s beard don’t connect…who’s braids don’t reach the back for their neck..🤷🏽‍♀️ …it is what it is. Women say all the time they don’t want short men; some don’t want light skin men, men with a receding hairline, my point is leave this man be it’s not that deep this is a preference. All of you getting Offended when let’s be serious we all like what we like. I really hate how the black community is acting as we done forgot what black people mean when we say “good/nice hair” as in loosely curled hair🤦🏾‍♀️ IDC that that’s his preference, he needs to be truthful, own it and says that’s what he meant periodt.”</p><p>One critic told the crooner: “Honestly the way he’s degrading women is absolutely DISGUSTING. He is too old for this at least be mature enough for YOURSELF and set an example for your DAUGHTER, but y’all will let him get away with anything.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BzUtmQPhHxN/</p><p>Another commenter stated: “This is kinda disappointing I’m not mad at the lyrics because it doesn’t really surprise me. I’m disappointed in his reaction to his fans. On my life, I will never ever support anything with his name. He beats women. What do you expect? 🙄”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Chris will have to be more creative to deal with the backlash.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv4ybqaivnmKvra3Srapmr5%2Bisq951qKroWWjoLaledGorqdllZm0pr%2BMmqWdZZ%2Bbs6a%2B0maroZ2dYrOzscRmrqKfo2K2r3nNnq5mmZ6cv7p5z6iqrWWUmrOmusOipaBlmJ7AbrzRnp2eqpWjsKZ5xaipZp%2BZp7m0edaiq6Flnp6wpnnHmqCrZWJuhXF%2Fkmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
