The successful reboot has brought the mother of three more problems than it’s worth and she is letting it go on without her.</p><p>According to US Weekly, some of her castmates found out with the rest of the world. Snooki allegedly didn’t tell everyone that she stars with that she made the decision to leave.</p><p>‘Nicole did not tell all her&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;castmates that&nbsp;she was retiring before she made the announcement. It came as a surprise to more than one of them.’</p><p>If the rumor is true, it’s pretty safe to say that Angelina Pivarnick is one of the people she didn’t let in on the secret.</p><p>Angelina’s wedding roast from the three other female cast members went viral in the worst way possible. This led to the MTV personality to be slammed online to the point where she received death threats.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5nj-_sFIYH/</a></p><p>Before Pivarnick’s wedding even commenced, JWoww and Snooki were deemed ‘mean girls’ by both fans of the show and Angelina for the way they treated her during the scandal where Zack Carpinello grabbed the newlywed inappropriately during a night out.</p><p>Overzealous viewers took what they felt about the show out on Nicole Polizzi’s place of business. They left bad reviews on The Snooki Shop’s Yelp page after the episodes aired!</p><p>All this and more added to the reasons the 32-year-old gracefully bowed out.</p><p>Polizzi explained during her podcast: ‘You know, when I leave my kids and I film the show, like, I want to have a good time. And I’m putting myself out there, and I just wanna come off as a good person. And lately, on the show,&nbsp;it’s just been very drama. … I don’t like the person I’m portrayed as.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Who else do you think Snooki left out of the loop?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGejo7ywt8hmm6KcXaO8tXnTnqOlZZGhuW60xKtko52iqLK6edKhpqudXZiutMDMmqueq12otaZ51pqqZqmlnsG1tc2gZGxsaGiCdHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
