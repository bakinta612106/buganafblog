"I'm a lot more chilled. My brain was always in overdrive. I always used to have music on all the time, everywhere I walked. If I went to get a glass of water in the kitchen I would put my headphones in. I walked 45 minutes the other day and I walked back with no music and my head was so clear. I'm a lot more chilled and enjoy life a lot more, with a lot less anxiety."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1235826672.jpg><p><span>Social media plays a big role in Hart's life. However, she revealed </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>in this Instagram post</span></a><span>, that she's not taking it so seriously anymore. She wrote in the caption, "So obviously as an apparent influencer I have to take pictures and post them, easy yeah? Not for me. I hate all pictures of myself and then I get upset and then Sam gets upset coz I'm upset and it's just one big circle. Today he had an idea to get up early, bring a few swimsuits down to the beach, shoot all of them and then be able to relax and not worry. Now obviously Sam used to be a model (ALDI hot cross bun man 2016 don't you know) so he had gone full out creative director. Went on a location scout around yesterday, researched the geo tags on insta, found some poses on Google and then coached me through it all (whilst being my main hype man) and I don't actually hate these pics!"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/GettyImages-1235804169.jpg><p><span>Hart infamously decided to walk off her season of Love Island. However, she did this to help benefit her mental health and wellbeing. She tells </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour</span></a><span>, "If you stay in longer, you'll get more followers and you'll get more work.
