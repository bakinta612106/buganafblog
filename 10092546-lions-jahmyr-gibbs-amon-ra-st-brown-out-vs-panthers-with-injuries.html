He has yet to score a touchdown.</p><p>Montgomery will be the Lions' unquestioned top option in the running game with Craig Reynolds and Zonovan Knight backing him up.</p><p>Since it seems likely that Gibbs will become more involved and a bigger part of the offense as the season progresses, Detroit may be simply taking a cautious approach with him this week.</p><p>With or without Gibbs, the 3-1 Lions are substantial home favorites against the 0-4 Panthers on Sunday, and the expectation is that they will win and maintain their spot atop the NFC North.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWeCdYKMpaCopqNit6K0zLKpZp%2BZl6%2B0ecCmpqdlopZ6tMCMm6mor55ivLbAjK%2BqZqiRo8GpsdGsZLChpJ16qrrJrqminaM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
