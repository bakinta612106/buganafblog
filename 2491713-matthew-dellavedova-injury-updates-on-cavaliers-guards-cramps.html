Spears</a> of Yahoo Sports reported Dellavedova is suffering from fatigue, but will play in Game 4, according to head coach David Blatt. Earlier in the day, Bleacher Report's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan Skolnick</a> reported that the point guard was taking part in the team's practice.&nbsp;</p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Stein</a> noted Dellavedova was hospitalized and treated for dehydration and severe cramping following Game 3.</p><p>"That's probably the tiredest I’ve been. I’m feeling good now, though. It’s good we don’t have to play back-to-backs," Dellavedova said, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Sports NBA</a>.</p><p>Dellavedova scored a season-high 20 points and was the Cavaliers' second-best player on the court most of the night. The former undrafted free agent has been a revelation in these Finals, taking over for an injured <a href=#>Kyrie Irving</a> to hound <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a> on defense and provide an occasional spark on the other end. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN Stats & Info</a> noted Dellavedova and LeBron James assisted on or scored 78 of Cleveland's 96 points in the Game 3 triumph.</p><p><span>Blatt praised his point guard, per&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Deveney</a><span>&nbsp;of Sporting News:</span></p><p>He's had some games like this. I just think he plays as hard as he can every day. He plays right. He's not afraid, he plays courageously. And everybody on this team has his back. So it's not an issue of confidence. He's going to give you whatever he has, and you can't ask for any more than that.</p><p>If for some reason Dellavedova is unable to go, J.R. Smith would likely step into the starting lineup. Or who knows, maybe the Cavs will bring back Dajuan Wagner. Anything's possible given their injury issues at this point.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW1xYWx%2BdHnMmqutoJWseqWxy6WYr52UpMOiecinoa6qqWLCsbDArZysZZ%2BjeqSt1Zqjop2iqHqowcCrm6xlk6eurrzS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
