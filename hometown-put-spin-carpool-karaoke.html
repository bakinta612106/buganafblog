We get to see them singing their tracks ‘Cry For Help’ and ‘Where I Belong’ which seemed to go down very well with the fans.</p><p>The video was great fun and is good for people who don’t know much about the boys as well because it’s definitely a funny one to watch. We also get to see a sneak peek at some of their dancing which they love putting into their live performances to make them even more exciting and it shows us just how talented they all are. The guys all constantly have so much energy and this video wasn’t an exception and as there’s six of them their jokes are constantly bouncing off one another.</p><p>The video shows us how down to earth the guys from HomeTown really are. One minute they’re telling us about one of their headline shows and the next about stuff they’d brought while shopping. They are so genuine and this just makes us love them even more!</p><p>The best part of the video for us was getting to see Brendan’s impression of their manager, Louis Walsh, so if that doesn’t want to make you watch it I don’t know what will!</p><p>If you would like to watch the video it is available here and make sure to let us know what you thought of the video by commenting below or tweeting us @CelebMix</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktbC5xK2msKZdpcK1edKpoKdlk5a%2FsbvOpWSkmaKWvKyxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
