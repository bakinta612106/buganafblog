However, nearly all parties involved have since denied that the crossed paths were intended.</p><p>When Lamar stopped by Entertainment Tonight Live on Tuesday, the basketball player discussed not only the chance meeting with his ex but also the hard emotional hit he took when he was booted off Dancing With The Stars.</p><p>During the sit-down with hosts of the show, Lamar discussed the published paparazzi photos of he and the Kardashian clan hanging out in the same venue, Hyde Nightclub, in LA this past weekend. Kylie Jenner was there – as was Tyga.</p><p>Lamar said to hosts of the show that it was “funny,” because people told him Khloe and her sister were there, but he never actually saw them. The basketball player joked, “that’s why they call it club Hyde.” Lamar added that he did, however, run into Lebron James in there, but not Khloe or her sister.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VD96nACF9/</p><p>When the ex-love birds do run into each other, however, it’s “all love.” The NBA alum stated that when he sees her, she gives him a nice kiss on the cheek, and tells him it’s good to see him again. As fans of the Kar-Jenner clan know, Lamar and Khloe, who are 39 and 35 respectively, got married back in September of 2009.</p><p>They married just one month after they first met, however, Khloe filed for divorce in December of 2013, but they didn’t finalize the proceedings until three years later in the same month. The reason for this had to do with Lamar’s hospitalization at the time because of a drug overdose.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Lamar overdosed in a Nevada brothel and nearly died. During his recovery, Khloe was by the basketball player’s side, in addition to her family. Since then, the pair have been friends. Lamar told the interviewers that he felt that “all good things come to an end,” and he’s happy he has a “sister now.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclrqivoyom6ilXZaxpb7ErKqeq12nwq670axkraCRqXqpsYywmKxlmJa7qLXNoGSaqp%2Bqu6V5xLFksKGWmnqstMuonGajkaexor%2FHopinZZGcrqq6jGxpcWpoZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
